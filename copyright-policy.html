                        Welcome to MasjidAlAqsa.com. Our mission is to educate users about the historical and religious
                        significance of Masjid Al-Aqsa, and focusing on the rich history of Palestine. As a
                        non-profit and educational website, we are committed to spreading knowledge truthfully and
                        respectfully. Our mission extends to educating users about the harsh realities of the brutal
                        Israeli occupation.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Non-Profit and Educational Nature
