                        Palestine is known as the <strong>Land of the Prophets</strong>, the Land of Ambiyaa, due to the
                        large numbers of Prophets, sent by the Almighty ALLAH <span class="ar-unicode">&#65019;</span>,
                        who resided in this land and
                        carried out their sacred missions, profoundly shaping its spiritual legacy.

                        hadith:

                    <p>Most scholars concur that Adam (as) laid the foundations of Ka'aba when he was sent to
                        earth, leading to the belief that <strong>Adam (as) built Masjid Al-Aqsa</strong> after 40
                        years.</p>

                    <p>Prophet Ibrahim (as) spent many years in Palestine with his family. His tomb is located at the
                        <strong>Ibrahimi Mosque</strong> (Masjid-e-Khalil) in Hebron, Palestine, where he
                        is buried with his

                    <h2 id="lut">Prophet Lut (as)</h2>

                    <p><strong>Prophet Lut (as)</strong> was the paternal nephew of Prophet Ibrahim (as). He was
                        commanded by Allah
                        (SWT) to spread the message of Islam to the people of <strong>Sodom and Gomorrah</strong>,
                        cities of ancient Palestine. It is
                        stated in the
                        Quran that the community was subsequently destroyed after they failed to take heed, and Prophet
                        Lut (as) and his family were saved, with the exception of his wife.</p>
                    <p>It is believed that the community lived in what is now the <strong>Dead Sea</strong>, a salt lake
                        situated between
                        the West Bank and Jordan.</p>
                    <p><strong>Bani Na'im</strong> is a Palestinian town located south of Hebron in the occupied West
                        Bank. The tomb of Prophet Lut (as) is located here. The tomb of his daughters can be found
                        on a
                        hill nearby.</p>

                        dedication to Allah <span class="ar-unicode">&#65019;</span>, his leadership is also deeply

                    <p>The maqam of Prophet Dawud (as) is located at Mount Zion, Jerusalem, Palestine. Islamic tradition
                        believes that the site is in fact a
                        'maqam’', which marks the place where he had once stayed, so <strong>this is not confirmed to be
                            the actual tomb</strong> as jews believe.</p>

                    <p>Prophet Sulaiman (as), born in Jerusalem, was the youngest son of Prophet Dawood (as). Allah
                        (SWT) endowed him with remarkable abilities, such as the power to communicate with animals and
                        to command the Jinns. After inheriting the throne from his father, Prophet Dawood (as),
                        Prophet Sulaiman (as) <strong>reigned over Palestine</strong> for 30 years.</p>

                    <p>At the time of Prophet Dawud (as)
                        and Sulaiman (as), Masjid Al-Aqsa had fallen into ruin. Dawud (as) was initially given the noble
                        task of rebuilding the mosque, but he passed away before
                        completing it, leaving the duty to his son, Sulaiman (as).
                    </p>
                    <p>Prophet Sulaiman, known for his <strong>rule over people and jinn</strong>, had a
                        considerable amount
                        of support in rebuilding Masjid Al-Aqsa. However, he was concerned that his time in this world
                        was coming to an end. During the reconstruction, he made a special prayer (du'a) to Allah:</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote py-3 px-3 py-sm-4 px-sm-4 my-4 my-sm-5">
                        <p class="mb-0">
                            When Prophet Sulaiman finished building Bayt al Muqaddas (Masjid Al Aqsa), he asked Allah
                            for three things: (1) a judgement that was in harmony with His judgment, (2) a dominion that
                            no
                            one after him would have, and (3) that no one should come to this mosque intending to pray
                            there without emerging free of sin as the day his mother bore him,"<br><br>
                            The Prophet <span class="ar-unicode">&#xFDFA;</span> then said; "Two prayers were granted,
                            and I hope that the third was
                            also
                            granted."
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-light-brown mt-3 mb-0">[Ibn Majah]</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>SubhanAllah, although Sulaiman (as) passed away while rebuilding the Masjid, Allah still
                        answered his du'a, by ensuring the rebuilding work continued.
                    </p>
                    <p>In a miraculous event, Sulaiman (as) remained standing, leaning on his walking
                        stick, <strong>even after his soul left his body</strong>. This led the workers to believe that
                        he was still
                        supervising them, so they continued their work until the mosque was completely rebuilt. It was
                        only when a group of termites had eaten through his walking stick, causing it to no longer
                        support him, that he fell to the ground. <strong>[Mentioned in Quran 34:12-14]</strong>
                    </p>

                            When We decreed Sulaiman's death, nothing indicated to the ˹subjected˺ jinn that he was dead
                            except the termites eating away his staff. So when he collapsed, the jinn realized that if
                            they had ˹really˺ known the unseen, they would not have remained in ˹such˺ humiliating
                            servitude.

                    <p>With most scholars citing Bethlehem, in today’s occupied West Bank, as the birth place of Prophet
                        Isa (as), he spent his life in Palestine, spreading the message of Allah <span

                        (as) was bestowed with many miracles, being able to heal the sick and bring the dead back to

                    <p>The <strong>Mount of Olives</strong> in Al-Quds is said to be the site where Prophet Isa (as)
                        ascended to

                    <p>The <strong>Minret of Isa (as)</strong> at Umayyad Mosque, Damascus, is where Isa (as) will

                    <p>The <strong>Masjid Al-Aqsa</strong> in Jerusalem, Palestine, is the first Qibla, second mosque on

                        ascended to

                        moment in Islamic
                        history, and the journey includes the Prophet's visitation to
                        the heavens where he met various prophets and received the instructions for the Muslim prayer
                        (Salah).
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Buraq</strong> was the name of the heavenly steed on which the Prophet <span

                        his nocturnal journey from
                        Makkah to Jerusalem, and then to the heavens. There's a mosque built, inside Al-Aqsa compound,
