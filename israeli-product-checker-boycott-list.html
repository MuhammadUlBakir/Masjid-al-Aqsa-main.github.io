                    <h2 class="font-h3">What is BDS?</h2>
                    <p>
                        As defined by the <a href="https://bdsmovement.net" target="_blank">BDS movement</a>, BDS stands
                        for a Palestinian-led initiative aimed at advocating for freedom, justice, and equality,
                        grounded in the belief that Palestinians deserve the same rights as all humans.
                    </p>

                    <p>This movement highlights the ongoing occupation and colonization of Palestinian territories by
                        Israel, the discrimination against Palestinian citizens within Israel, and the denial of the
                        right of return to Palestinian refugees. Drawing inspiration from the South African
                        anti-apartheid movement, BDS seeks to mobilize international support and action to encourage
                        Israel to adhere to international laws.</p>

                    <p>
                        In recent years, the call to boycott Israeli products has gained momentum across various parts
                        of
                        the globe. This movement, driven by political, social, and ethical considerations, seeks to
                        apply
                        economic pressure on Israel concerning its brutal assaults and policies. Through this article,
                        we delve
                        into
                        the essence of these boycott campaigns, their effects, and how tools like "Israeli product
                        checkers"
                        can empower consumers to make informed decisions.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="font-h3">Understanding the Boycott Movement</h2>
                    <p>
                        The boycott of Israeli products is part of a broader strategy known as BDS (Boycott, Divestment,
                        Sanctions), aiming to exert pressure on Israel to stop the colonization and oppression of
                        Palestinians and to change its policies towards the Palestinians.
                        This movement draws inspiration from the historic boycott of apartheid South Africa, suggesting
                        that
                        similar tactics could lead to significant political and social changes.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Key Campaigns and Their Objectives</h3>
                    <p>
                        Several campaigns around the world encourage consumers to avoid purchasing Israeli products.
                        These campaigns are often rooted in opposition to specific policies or actions and aim to
                        promote
                        human rights and international law. They target a range of products, from agricultural goods to
                        high-tech devices, and involve a variety of tactics, including protests, educational programs,
                        and social
                        media campaigns.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Effects of Boycott Campaigns</h3>
                    <p>
                        The impact of these campaigns is undeniable. Economically, they can lead to decreased sales
                        and changes in market dynamics for Israeli companies. Politically, they can generate significant
                        public discourse, potentially leading to shifts in policy, and increased awareness of the
                        non-stop genocide of Palestinians committed by Israel.
                        Socially, they foster a sense of global solidarity with the Palestinian cause.

                    <h4>Starbucks</h4>
                    <p>The company's stock market
                        price saw a <strong class="highlight-blue">notable decrease</strong>. Reportedly, Starbucks
                        <strong>lost $11 billion</strong> in December, 2023, amid the boycott.
                    </p>

                    <h4>McDonald's</h4>
                    <p>
                        McDonald's sales got affected globally, especially in the Middle East. The CEO, Chris
                        Kempczinski,
                        officially admitted and
                        said that several markets in the Middle East and some outside region experienced a <strong
                            class="highlight-blue">"meaningful business effects."</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h4>SodaStream</h4>
                    <p>
                        SodaStream is an Israeli company, bought by PepsiCo. In 2014, its stock price dropped as much as
                        by
                        20% amid the calls to boycott Israeli products.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Utilizing Israeli Product Checkers</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the digital age, technology offers novel ways to participate in these campaigns. Israeli
                        product checkers are online tools designed to help consumers identify products that are either
                        made in
                        Israel or have ties to Israeli companies. These tools are incredibly user-friendly and require
                        users to simply enter a brand or company name to determine its origin or affiliations.
                    </p>
