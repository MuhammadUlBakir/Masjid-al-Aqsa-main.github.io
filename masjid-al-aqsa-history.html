                    <p>Masjid al-Aqsa is the first qibla, the second mosque on earth, and the third holiest site in the
                        world. Its history is marked by
                        profound religious significance, multiple liberations and reconstructions, and pivotal
                        historical moments.</p>

                    <h2 id="location">Where is it located?</h2>
                    <p>Masjid Al-Aqsa also referred to as <strong>Bayt al-Muqaddas</strong> or <strong>Al-Haram
                            Al-Sharif</strong> is located in the Old City of
                        <strong class="highlight-blue">Al-Quds/Jerusalem</strong> and covers an area of approximately
                        144,000 square
                        meters, which
                        constitutes
                        about 1/6th of the total area of the Old City. The entire Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is capable of
                        accommodating up to 500,000 worshippers.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Common Misconceptions:</h3>
                    <p>There is often confusion between Masjid Al-Aqsa, Qibli Masjid, and the Dome of the Rock. It is
                        important to clarify that <strong>Masjid Al-Aqsa is a vast compound</strong> that includes both
                        the
                        Qibli Masjid and the Dome of the Rock, along with numerous other structures, platforms, and
                        open courtyards situated both above and below ground level. The compound houses over 200
                        historical monuments representing various Islamic eras, making it a site of immense historical
                        and religious significance</p>

                    <p>The first mosque built on earth is Masjid Al-Haram (Ka'aba) in
                        Makkah. Subsequently, 40 years later, Masjid Al-Aqsa was established. This is supported by a
                        hadith:

                    <p>Most scholars concur that Prophet Adam (as) laid the foundations of Ka'aba when he was sent to
                        earth, leading to the belief that <strong>Adam (as) built Masjid Al-Aqsa</strong> after 40
                        years.</p>

                    <h2 id="reconstruction">Reconstruction by Prophet Sulaiman (AS)</h2>
                    <p>At the time of Prophet Dawud (as)
                        and Sulaiman (as), Masjid Al-Aqsa had fallen into ruin. Dawud (as) was initially given the noble
                        task of rebuilding the mosque, but he passed away before
                        completing it, leaving the duty to his son, Sulaiman (as).
                    </p>
                    <p>Prophet Sulaiman, known for his <strong>rule over people and jinn</strong>, had a
                        considerable amount
                        of support in rebuilding al-Aqsa. However, he was concerned that his time in this world
                        was coming to an end. During the reconstruction, he made a special prayer (du'a) to Allah:</p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote py-3 px-3 py-sm-4 px-sm-4 my-4 my-sm-5">
                        <p class="mb-0">
                            When Prophet Sulaiman finished building Bayt al Muqaddas (Masjid Al Aqsa), he asked Allah
                            for three things: (1) a judgement that was in harmony with His judgment, (2) a dominion that
                            no
                            one after him would have, and (3) that no one should come to this mosque intending to pray
                            there without emerging free of sin as the day his mother bore him,"<br><br>
                            The Prophet <span class="ar-unicode">&#xFDFA;</span> then said; "Two prayers were granted,
                            and I hope that the third was
                            also
                            granted."
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-light-brown mt-3 mb-0">[Ibn Majah]</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>SubhanAllah, although Sulaiman (as) passed away while rebuilding the Masjid, Allah still
                        answered his du'a, by ensuring the rebuilding work continued.
                    </p>
                    <p>In a miraculous event, Sulaiman (Peace be upon him) remained standing, leaning on his walking
                        stick, <strong>even after his soul left his body</strong>. This led the workers to believe that
                        he was still
                        supervising them, so they continued their work until the mosque was completely rebuilt. It was
                        only when a group of termites had eaten through his walking stick, causing it to no longer
                        support him, that he fell to the ground. <strong>[Mentioned in Quran 34:12-14]</strong>
                    </p>

                            When We decreed Sulaiman's death, nothing indicated to the ˹subjected˺ jinn that he was dead
                            except the termites eating away his staff. So when he collapsed, the jinn realized that if
                            they had ˹really˺ known the unseen, they would not have remained in ˹such˺ humiliating
                            servitude.

                    <p>In 586 BCE, the Babylonians burned down Masjid Al-Aqsa, significantly damaging it. However,
                        by Allah's will, some of the <strong>underground level was preserved</strong> and remains intact
                        to this day,
                        situated beneath today's Qibli Masjid.</p>
                    <p>In the 6th century BCE, Jews <strong>built a temple</strong> they call "the Second Temple" at the
                        compound.</p>
                    <p>Then Romans came and <strong>destroyed the Second Temple</strong> in 70 CE.</p>
                    <p>After the division of the Roman Empire in the late 3rd and 4th centuries CE, the eastern half
                        continued to thrive and became known as the Byzantine Empire</p>
                    <p>During the control of the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, the
                        compound of al-Aqsa (Bayt-ul-Muqaddas) became a <strong>rubble pit</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Byzantines built the <strong>Church of the Holy Sepulchre</strong> in the 4th century CE
                        approximately 0.5
                        kilometers away from the al-Aqsa compound which translates to a walking distance of
                        around 10 minutes.</p>

                    <p>Masjid al-Aqsa houses <strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> which is the location from where
                        Muhammad <span class="ar-unicode">&#xFDFA;</span>
                        ascended to
                        Heaven during the Night Journey known as <strong>Isra and Mi'raj</strong>. The journey includes
                        the Prophet's visitation to
                        the heavens where he met various prophets and received the instructions for the Muslim prayer
                        (Salah).

                    <p><strong>Buraq</strong> was the name of the heavenly steed on which the Prophet <span

                        his nocturnal journey from
                        Makkah to Jerusalem, and then to the heavens. There's a mosque built, inside Al-Aqsa compound,
                        at the location where he tied the steed.</p>

                    <h2 id="liberation">The Liberation by Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA)</h2>
                    <p>In 637 CE, after the victorious <strong>Battle of Yarmuk</strong>, the Muslim armies, under
                        commanders like
                        Khalid ibn al-Walid and Amr ibn al-'As, encircled Jerusalem. The Patriarch of Jerusalem insisted
                        that the Caliph himself must come to Jerusalem – only then he will surrender the city. Caliph
                        Umar (RA) made the journey to Jerusalem to accept its surrender personally, signifying the
                        importance and peaceful nature of the conquest. He was greeted with respect by Patriarch
                        Sophronius and given a tour of the city.</p>
                    <p>During the treaty negotiations when the prayer time came and Caliph Umar (RA) wanted to pray,
                        the Patriarch offered to arrange his prayer in the Cathedral itself. At this, Caliph Umar (RA)
                        said
                        that he does not want to pray in the Cathedral because later generations might demolish it and
                        build a mosque there; that he does not want to set such a precedent.</p>
                    <p>So, Caliph Umar (RA) <strong class="highlight-blue">prayed outside of the Cathedral's
                            precincts</strong> where prophet
                        Dawud (David)
                        was believed to have prayed.</p>

                    <div class="focus-section mb-4">
                        <p>In 1193, Ayyubid Sultan al-Afdal (Son of Salahuddin Ayyubi) built the <strong>"Mosque of
                                Umar"</strong> at
                            that
                            place in respect of him. It's just a throne away from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <p><strong>The Treaty of Umar</strong>, which he signed with Patriarch Sophronius, assured the
                        inhabitants of
                        Al-Quds/Jerusalem of their safety, the security of their property and places of worship, and
                        freedom of
                        religion. This treaty is one of the earliest and most significant guarantees of religious
                        freedom in
                        history, setting a precedent for Muslim-Christian relations and protecting the rights of
                        conquered
                        peoples. The treaty's progressive nature allowed for the coexistence of different faiths under
                        Islamic rule.
                    </p>

                    <p>When Caliph <strong>Umar arrived at the Masjid Al-Aqsa</strong>, which was rubble at that time,
                        he started
                        picking up the garbage. Looking at him, his soldiers joined and soon the compound was cleaned.
                        Then Caliph Umar commissioned the construction of a wooden mosque on the southern end of
                        the compound facing the rock that marks the site of Isra and Mi'raj. The location of this mosque
                        is where the current Qibli Mosque stands.

                    <h2 id="umayyad">Umayyad Caliphate</h2>
                    <p>In the 7th century, Caliph 'Abdul Malik built the magnificent <strong>Dome of the Rock</strong>.
                        As part of the
                        al-Aqsa Mosque, it was not a separate house of worship, nor was it meant to compete with the
                        Al Aqsa Mosque, but was meant as a complement to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>With its distinctive gold-plated dome, it stands out in the city's skyline. Its octagonal design
                        is
                        adorned with elaborate Islamic tile work, Quranic verses, and calligraphy, reflecting the
                        artistic
                        excellence of the era. Inside, the decoration is equally impressive, featuring detailed mosaics
                        and
                        marble columns</p>
                    <p>Given the magnificence of the building, some modern historians have argued that 'Abd al-Malik
                        intended the building to be a rival to the Ka'bah in Makkah. Had he intended to do so, Muslim
                        scholars of the time would have no doubt expressed outrage and recorded his blasphemous
                        intentions in books written during that time. However, there exists no contemporary account of
                        him having such an intention, and the earliest mention of this idea was written 200 years later,
                        by
                        someone meant to be with a strong anti-Umayyad bias.</p>



                    <h2 id="decline">Decline under the Fatimid Period</h2>
                    <p>During the Fatimid period, which began with their control over Jerusalem in 970 AD, the Al-Aqsa
                        compound experienced both decline and renewal. The Fatimid Empire, based in Egypt and
                        belonging to the Ismaili sect of Shi'ism, had a profound impact on the city. Initially, the
                        Fatimid
                        rule disrupted the flourishing educational activities within Al-Aqsa, replacing them with
                        official
                        Shi'a institutions and leading to a period where Islamic education in the city was notably
                        reduced.</p>
                    <p>The most tumultuous time was under the rule of Abdul Hakim, starting in 996 AD, who imposed
                        <strong>harsh measures</strong>. It's said that he outlawed the Muslim fast of Ramadan, and
                        prevented Muslims
                        from going to Makkah for pilgrimage. By the end of his rule in 1021, the city of Jerusalem had
                        all lost its status as a center of Islamic scholarship. Beyond that, he also oppressed
                        Christians
                        and Jews in Jerusalem, and destroyed the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in <strong
                            class="highlight-red">direct conflict with the promises of 'Umar in 637.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>However, subsequent moderate Fatimid rulers took a more accommodating stance towards Al-Aqsa and
                        its history. After a significant earthquake in the 1030s, they renovated the mosque,
                        resulting in the structure with a central nave and seven grand arches that are more or less
                        unchanged to this day.</p>
                    <p>This period ended when the <strong>Seljuk Turks</strong>, Sunni Muslims from Central Asia, took
                        Jerusalem in
                        1073 AD, which marked the return of Islamic scholarship and the revival of intellectual
                        activities
                        within the city</p>


                    <h2>Crusaders</h2>
                    <p><strong>Conquest of Jerusalem (1099 AD):</strong> The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099
                        after a long
                        march filled with battles. Upon their arrival, they initiated an infamous massacre,
                        indiscriminately killing people in streets, homes, and alleyways.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Massacre at Masjid Al-Aqsa:</strong> The Muslims sought refuge in Al Masjid Al-Aqsa,
                        but the
                        Crusaders entered the mosque and <strong class="highlight-red">committed a massive
                            massacre</strong>, killing thousands of Muslims
                        within its confines. Following this, Masjid Al Aqsa was converted into a palace. This event
                        marked one of the darkest and bloodiest days in the mosque's history.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Conversion of Religious Sites:</strong> After their victory, the Crusaders converted
                        the mosques into
                        churches, renaming the <strong>Dome of the Rock</strong> to the Temple of God and
                        <strong>Mosque Al-Aqsa</strong> to the
                        Temple of Solomon. The whole compound was made off-limits to all non-Christians, becoming
                        the center of religious and civil life in Crusader Jerusalem.
                    </p>



                    <h2 id="salahuddin">Liberation by Sultan Salahuddin Ayyubi</h2>
                    <p>The turning point came with the decisive <strong>Battle of Hattin</strong> in July 1187, where
                        Salahuddin
                        defeated the Crusaders who had attacked Muslim pilgrims. This victory paved the way for his
                        <strong class="highlight-blue">liberating Jerusalem in October 1187.</strong> When
                        Salahuddin
                        entered Jerusalem, he did so with
                        humility and forbade any massacre or plunder of Christians, in stark contrast to the actions of
                        the
                        Crusaders during their siege in 1099. He even paid the ransom for those who could not afford it,
                        ensuring their safe departure from the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>For Salahuddin, the conquest of Jerusalem and Masjid Al-Aqsa was not just a military victory
                        but also a fulfillment of a profound religious aspiration. His commitment to Islamic law and the
                        liberation of al-Aqsa was deeply ingrained in his leadership and military strategy. Upon
                        entering
                        Al-Aqsa, he purified the mosque personally along with his soldiers with
                        rose-water, reminiscent of the earlier liberation by <strong>Caliph Umar Ibn Al
                            Khattab</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Salahuddin's conquest of Al-Quds signified the end of the Christian rule established in 1099
                        and brought <strong>Palestine</strong> back into the fold of the Muslim world. His respectful
                        and just treatment
                        of the defeated Christian population earned him admiration and respect, not only among Muslims
                        but also among non-Muslims.
                    </p>
                    <p>After he died in 1193, the Ayyubid Dynasty of his descendants continued to rule over Jerusalem
                        and take charge of its defense from Crusader attacks. In the late 1200s and early 1300s, the
                        Ayyubid Dynasty gradually gave way to the new <strong>Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt</strong> which
                        was ruled
                        by Turkish soldiers.</p>


                    <h3 class="p-0 border-0">Minbar of Salahuddin Ayyubi</h3>

                    <p>Three minbars were constructed for Salahuddin, one for Masjid al-Aqsa, second
                        for Masjid al-Azhar in Cairo, and third one for Masjid-e-Ibrahimi in Palestine which is
                        the only surviving minbar out of three.</p>

                    <p>The al-Aqsa Minbar was made by Nuruddin Zangi, specifically constructed and intended for the
                        liberation of al-Aqsa.</p>

                    <p>
                        In 1969, Denis Michael, an <strong>Australian terrorist</strong>, <strong
                            class="highlight-red">torched al-Aqsa on fire</strong> that
                        destroyed several parts of the mosque including the minbar.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In response to this loss, a reconstruction project was undertaken. A new minbar, mirroring the
                        original in design and materials, was created by an international team of experts in Jordan.
                        This
                        replica was installed in Al-Aqsa Mosque in 2007.

                    <h2 id="ottoman">Ottoman Caliphate</h2>
                    <p>The Ottoman Empire was emerging as a new mega-power in the Muslim world. Sultan Selim I
                        peacefully took control of Jerusalem in 1516 from the Mamluks. The city was made the capital
                        of the <strong>sanjak of Jerusalem</strong>, and the
                        Ottomans
                        sent governors, soldiers, and administrators to manage it.</p>
                    <p>The Ottoman period was characterized by significant <strong>construction and beautification
                            efforts</strong>,
                        particularly under <strong>Sulaiman al-Kanuni</strong>, who came to governance in 1520. Notable
                        renovations
                        included the complete overhaul of the Dome of the Rock, which was covered in marble, colored
                        tiles, and calligraphy, featuring verses from the Quran. Suleyman also commissioned a
                        <strong>fountain</strong>
                        near the main entrance of the Al-Aqsa Mosque for ritual purification (wudu) and ordered the
                        rebuilding of the city walls, which still stand today.
                    </p>


                    <h2 id="british">British Occupation</h2>
                    <p>Under centuries of Ottoman rule, Jerusalem, including the Al-Aqsa Mosque, maintained a status
                        quo with Muslims in administrative charge while Jews and Christians were given religious
                        freedom. This balance was disrupted with the emergence of the <strong>Zionist movement</strong>
                        in Europe,
                        which sought to establish an exclusively Jewish state in Jerusalem and surrounding areas. When
                        their requests were <strong>denied by the Ottoman ruler</strong> Sultan Abdul Hamid II in the
                        late 1800s,
                        Zionists turned to the British during World War I.</p>
                    <p>The British captured Jerusalem in 1917, marking the first time since the Crusades that the city
                        was under non-Muslim control. However, unlike the Crusades, there was no massacre, and the
                        Muslim community continued to control the Haram area, albeit under British oversight — a slow
                        poison.</p>
                    <p>The British control over Jerusalem led to <strong>increased Jewish immigration</strong> from
                        Europe. Hundreds
                        of thousands of Jews emigrated to Palestine, many settling in Jerusalem and forcefully occupying
                        the homes and lands of Palestinian people.</p>


                    <h2 id="apartheid">Creation of Israel Apartheid State</h2>
                    <p>By 1948, when the British withdrew from Palestine, the stage was set for the establishment of
                        Israel. Hundreds of Zionist arms groups opened fire at thousands of Palestinian civilians,
                        including women and children, causing great suffering.</p>
                    <p>The Nakba began — 750,000 Palestinians were displaced, around 530 villages and cities were
                        destroyed, over 125,000
                        homes were demolished, and over <strong class="highlight-red">15,000 Palestinian civilians were
                            killed</strong>, marking a
                        genocide.</p>


                    <p>Following the Arab-Israeli War in 1948-49, Al-Quds was divided into <strong>West
                            Jerusalem</strong>, occupied by
                        Israel, and <strong>East Jerusalem</strong>, controlled by Jordan.</p>


                    <p>The situation changed dramatically in 1967. During the Six-Day War, Israeli troops
                        occupied
                        East Jerusalem as well. This occupation was a significant turning point,
                        marked by the flying of an Israeli flag atop the Dome of the Rock and <strong>damage to the
                            mosque</strong>
                        from a fire started by an Australian terrorist.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The occupation led to strict
                        controls on Muslim
                        entry into Jerusalem, with most non-resident Muslims barred from praying at the mosque. While
                        a Muslim-controlled waqf officially manages the Haram area, entry is strictly overseen by
                        Israeli
                        police who usually prohibit access deliberately during prayer times.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Israeli Incursions and Effects</h3>
                    <p>Israeli settlers and far-right activists, often backed by police, frequently enter the Al-Aqsa
                        Mosque, disregarding the site's Palestinian Muslim administration. These incursions have been a
                        long-standing source of tension and violence in East Jerusalem. Palestinians view these as
                        attempts to "Judaise" the city and erase its Islamic Palestinian heritage.</p>

                    <p>Israeli authorities have frequently overridden the Waqf's jurisdiction over non-Muslim visits to
                        Al-Aqsa Mosque, a practice established under an agreement with Jordan. This has frequently led
                        to confrontations and suppressive actions against Palestinians. Since Israel's occupation of
                        East Jerusalem in 1967, these raids on Al-Aqsa have persisted, involving violence and efforts to
                        change the historical status quo of the site.</p>

                    <h3>Current Status of Jerusalem</h3>
                    <p>Today, Israel occupies both East and West Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>West Jerusalem is almost-fully colonized by Jews, while East Jerusalem has a significant
                        Palestinian population who face regular discrimination and violence. Palestinians in East
                        Jerusalem also live under different legal and administrative rules than Israeli citizens.</p>
                    <p>Palestinian worshippers at Al-Aqsa often face recurring violence and assaults from the Israeli
                        military.</p>
