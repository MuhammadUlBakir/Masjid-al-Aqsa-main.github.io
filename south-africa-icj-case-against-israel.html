                    <p>In a significant legal development, South Africa has brought a case against Israel at the
                        International Court of Justice (ICJ), asserting the Israel's genocidal acts in Gaza.</p>

                    <h2>South Africa's Case</h2>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Initiated on December 29, South Africa's case against Israel at the ICJ centers on assertions of
                        "<strong>genocidal acts</strong>" during the Israeli assaults on Gaza. The South African
                        government seeks to leverage
                        the ICJ, the United Nations' highest legal body, to adjudicate on this matter, which they prove
                        violates the 1948 Genocide Convention.</p>

                    <h3>Claim: Genocidal Intent and Acts</h3>
                    <h4 class="pt-3">1. Mass Killings</h4>
                    <p>South Africa's legal team highlighted the mass killing of Palestinians in Gaza, emphasizing the
                        high number of children among the casualties. They presented evidence of mass graves, pointing
                        out that some families in Gaza have been entirely wiped out due to these actions.</p>

                    <div class="focus-section red mb-5">
                        <p>
                            Since October 7, Israel has killed at least <strong>26,083 Palestinian civilians</strong>,
                            including
                            10,000 children and 7,000 women. Additionally, at least 64,487 people are injured, with
                            more than 75% being children and women. More than 8,000 people are missing.

                    <h4>2. Bodily and Mental Harm</h4>
                    <p>The infliction of serious mental and bodily harm on the people of Gaza was another critical
                        point. South Africa underscored the extensive number of wounded and maimed individuals, most of
                        them women and children, in a region where the health system has collapsed due to intense
                        Israeli bombing.</p>

                    <h4 class="pt-3">3. Forced Displacement and Food Blockade</h4>
                    <p>
                        Israel stopped the entry of food, water, electricity, fuel, and aid into Gaza, exacerbating the
                        crisis. The UN denounced this as a form of collective punishment.</p>

                    <p>On November 10, intense bombing and armed pressure by Israel
                        resulted in the displacement of approximately 200,000 Palestinians within Gaza from
                        the north to the south. Overall, since October 7, the conflict has led to the
                        <strong class="highlight-red">displacement of over 1.6 million</strong> people from
                        their
                        homes.
                        This mass displacement significantly
                        strained the already fragile humanitarian situation in the region.
                    </p>

                    <p>This migration was characterized by large groups of people, including families with
                        children, the
                        elderly, and those with disabilities, who <strong>fled on foot</strong> with minimal
                        belongings, often waving
                        white flags as a sign of their civilian status. Multiple videos have confirmed that
                        Israeli
                        <strong>soldiers fired at civilians</strong>, including those fleeing barefoot from the
                        north waving white flags.
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="pt-3">4. Destruction of Healthcare System</h4>
                    <p>South Africa argued that Israel's military assaults have targeted Gaza’s healthcare system,
                        rendering life unsustainable. The already crippled healthcare system has been overwhelmed by the
                        need for life-saving treatment for the large number of injured.</p>

                    <p> Israel bombed Gaza's oldest hospital, <strong>Al Ahli Arab</strong>, on
                        the 17th of October, 2023, <strong class="highlight-red">killing nearly 500
                            people</strong>
                        marking the highest death toll of
                        any single incident in Gaza during the genocide. The victims were mostly displaced
                        people seeking shelter in the hospital. On the day of the strike, the hospital was
                        overwhelmed with about 1,000 to 3,000 people, as it and other medical facilities in Gaza
                        had been crammed with casualties beyond their capacity since the Israeli airstrikes
                        began.</p>

                    <h4>5. Preventing Palestinian Births</h4>
                    <p>Lastly, the South African team asserted that Israel is obstructing life-saving treatment needed
                        for
                        delivering babies, which amounts to preventing births in Gaza, a genocidal act per the 1948
                        Genocide Convention.</p>

                    <p>In one of the most heart-wrenching consequences of the conflict, <strong>premature
                            babies</strong> in Gaza's
                        hospitals have faced dire circumstances. At al-Shifa Hospital, premature babies had to be
                        evacuated amid intense conflict conditions. Some of these <strong class="highlight-red">infants
                            did not survive</strong>
                        the ordeal. There have been reports of premature babies dying due to the lack of adequate
                        medical care and the challenging conditions afflicted by Israel.

                    <p>Below are several statements made by current and former members of the Israeli government
                        after October 7, which compellingly indicate an intention towards the genocide of
                        Palestinians, rather than a focused engagement with resistance fighters. These statements
                        highlight a disregard for the civilian population in Gaza, underscoring a lack of concern
                        for
                        the

                            is not a gram of humanitarian aid, but hundreds of tons of explosives from the Air
                            Force<br><br>

                    </ul>
                    <p>It's also crucial to highlight that, despite the <strong>absence of Hamas in the West
                            Bank</strong>, Israeli
                        forces
                        have reportedly <strong>killed 340 Palestinians</strong>, including at least 84 children,
                        and
                        injured 3,949
                        people
                        there from Oct 7 to Jan 10. This raises serious questions about the targets of these
                        operations,
                        given that Hamas, often cited as a primary reason for Israeli military actions, does not
                        have a
                        presence in the West Bank.</p>

                    <h2>Israel's Response</h2>
                    <h4>Right to Self-Defense</h4>
                    <p>Israel's legal team, led by Malcolm Shaw KC, claimed the right to self-defense in response to
                        Hamas fighters' attacks on October 7. This argument, however, is contested. Critics argue that
                        Israel,
                        as an occupying force, <strong>cannot claim self-defense</strong>, citing a 2003 ICJ ruling. The
                        United Nations
                        and various human rights organizations challenge Israel's claim of not being an occupying power
                        in Gaza.</p>

                    <p>In 2007, Israel imposed an air, land, and sea blockade on the Strip,
                        contributing to severe economic and humanitarian crises, and putting <strong>restrictions on
                            essential resources</strong> like electricity, water, and fuel. Israel state also
                        built
                        a concrete wall around the Gaza Strip, making it nearly impossible to enter or leave since
                        then.</p>

                    <p>The United Nations and Amnesty International describe the Gaza
                        blockade as a form of <strong class="highlight-red">collective punishment</strong> of the
                        entire
                        population of Gaza,
                        amounting to a war crime and inhumane treatment under international law.

                    <p class="mb-3">Israel's defense characterized South Africa's claim of an inherent intent to destroy
                        the
                        Palestinian people as based on "random assertions." However, several statements made
                        by Israeli officials <strong class="highlight-red">prove the genocidal intent</strong> as can be
                        <a href="#genocidalStatements">read here</a>. Israel irrationally argues these
                        statements have been taken out of context.

                    <h4 class="pt-2">Response to Genocidal Actions</h4>
                    <p>In response to claims of mass civilian killings, Israel's defense pointed to Hamas using
                        civilians as human shields and efforts by Israeli troops to minimize civilian harm. Critics,
                        however, have cited instances of <strong class="highlight-red">unarmed civilians being
                            shot</strong>, including a case where a
                        Palestinian grandmother was killed while trying to evacuate.</p>

                    <p>Multiple videos have surfaced social media showing many Palestinian civilians, including
                        women and children, were shot even though they were <strong>waving white flags</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, the death toll of Hamas fighters is around 200, whereas that of Palestinian civilians
                        is 26,083. The
                        ratio itself indicates indiscriminate killing and genocidal nature.</p>

                    <h4 class="mt-5">Jurisdictional Challenges</h4>
                    <p>Israel questioned the ICJ's jurisdiction, arguing that South Africa did not properly communicate
                        with Israel before filing the case and that a prerequisite "dispute" between the two nations was
                        not established. This question from Israel is meaningless.</p>

                    <h4>Humanitarian Aid</h4>
                    <p>Israel contended that allegations of a blockade on Gaza are inaccurate, citing the number of food
                        aid trucks allowed into Gaza. However, this claim is disputed by reports from the UN and human
                        rights organizations, which describe the blockade as more severe and longstanding.</p>

                    <p>The humanitarian situation in Gaza is <strong class="highlight-red">extremely dire</strong>, with
                        widespread reports of starvation and
                        inadequate access to essential resources. The UN has repeatedly expressed deep concerns about
                        the
                        condition of civilians caught up in the conflict, emphasizing the escalating threat of
                        starvation
                        and disease in densely populated areas. This situation has been exacerbated by intense bombing
                        campaigns, leading to a significant number of people fleeing to areas like Rafah, where they
                        face
                        inadequate supplies and shelter.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        The starvation crisis in Gaza is so severe that the UN World Food Programme (WFP) has
                        highlighted
                        the norm of <strong>people skipping meals</strong> and the struggle for daily sustenance. The
                        situation is
                        particularly alarming for undernourished children, with half of Gaza’s population reportedly
                        starving.
                    </p>

                    <p>The UN health agency, WHO, has also warned of the imminent risk of communicable
                        diseases
                        due to the crisis. The numbers are staggering, with hundreds of thousands of people, including a
                        significant number of pregnant women and children, facing <strong>crisis-level food
                            insecurity</strong>.</p>

                    <h2>Next steps</h2>
                    <p>
                        After the public hearings at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), South Africa has
                        requested the ICJ to issue several orders against Israel, including
                        the suspension of military actions in Gaza, stopping forced displacement, and enabling
                        humanitarian
                        access.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The ICJ's decisions are legally binding, although it does not have an enforcement mechanism.
                        "Provisional measures" in the case, which take priority, could be decided relatively quickly,
                        possibly within a matter of weeks. These could range from ordering a temporary halt to the
                        assault, allowing humanitarian aid, or obligating Israel to adhere to international law.
                    </p>


                    <h2>Final Verdict Date</h2>
                    <p>
                        It's difficult to determine the ICJ final verdict date as it's not issued by ICJ yet.</p>
                    <p>
                        In the 2006 <strong>Bosnia vs. Serbia</strong> case, Bosnia accused Serbia of genocide during
                        the Yugoslav Wars.
                        The
                        ICJ issued final verdict in 2007.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The 2019 <strong>Gambia vs. Myanmar</strong> case saw provisional measures
                        implemented by the ICJ, urging Myanmar to stop committing genocide against the Rohingya, but a
                        final
                        verdict is yet to be issued.
