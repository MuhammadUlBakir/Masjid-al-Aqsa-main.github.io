                    <p>The land of Shaam, which includes Palestine, is known as the Land of the Ambiyaa – due to the
                        large numbers of Prophets, sent by the Almighty, who have lived therein, and fulfilled their
                        Divinely-ordained missions there.</p>

                        Explore the profound connections between various Messengers of Allah SWT and the
                        sacred land of Palestine, as depicted in the Qur'an, Ahadeeth, and historical narratives.
                        Recognizing Palestine's inherent sanctity as blessed by Allah SWT is vital. The deep bonds these
                        revered messengers of Allah formed with this land further highlight its sanctity and historical
                        spiritual importance

                    <p>The initial foundation of Masjid al Aqsa is attributed to Prophet Adam AS, based on the
                        following Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad <span class="ar-unicode">&#xFDFA;</span>:</p>

                            Sayyidina Abu Dharr RA reported that he
                            asked the Prophet SAW, “O Messenger of Allah, which masjid was built first on earth?” The
                            Prophet SAW replied, “The Sacred Masjid of Makkah.” Abu Dharr again asked, “Which was next?”
                            The Prophet SAW said, “The Masjid al-Aqsa.” Abu Dharr RA further asked, “How long was the
                            period between the building of the two masajid?” The Prophet SAW said, “Forty years.” Apart
                            from these, offer your prayers anywhere when it is time to pray, as excellence lies in
                            it.”

                            founded by Sayyidina Adam AS: “When Adam AS completed the foundation of the Ka’bah, Allah
                            SWT commanded him to travel to Bayt al Maqdis, where he laid the foundation [of Masjid al

                    <p>Lut AS was the nephew of Ibrahim AS.</p>
                    <p>Sayydina Ibrahim AS was wedded to Sarah RA, who remained barren for much of her life.</p>
                    <p>He later took on Hajar RA(a slave of African origin) as his second wife. Although Ibrahim AS was
                        very advanced in age, Hajar RA bore him his first son, Ismail AS.</p>
                    <p>Ibrahim AS was commanded by Allah SWT to leave Ismail AS and Hajar RA in the barren desert of
                        Makkah, an order he duly fulfilled.</p>
                    <p>Sayyidina Ibrahim AS’s primary place of residence however remained Palestine, where he dwelt
                        along with his first wife, Sarah RA.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, he made several visits to Makkah. It was during these that he encountered the Divine
                        Test of being commanded to sacrifice Ismail AS. It was also along with this son of his that the
                        Ka’bah was rebuilt.</p>
                    <p>When Ibrahim AS was approximately 100 years of age, Allah SWT gave him glad tidings of yet
                        another son – this time to be born to Sarah RA.</p>
                    <p>Ishaaq AS, who also was to become a Messenger of Allah lived and fulfilled his mission in the
                        vicinity of al Quds.</p>
                    <p>Together with his father, Ishaaq AS, was also responsible for the rebuilding of Masjid al Aqsa –
                        a parallel to how Ismail AS rebuilt the Ka’bah with his father in Makkah.</p>
                    <p>Both Ibrahim and Ishaaq AS passed away in Palestine. They are buried in the city of al-Khalil(ur
                        Rahmaan), named in honour of Ibrahim AS. It is said that Ibrahim AS purchased a cave area here
                        as a burial site for his wife Sarah RA. The grave of Ishaaq AS’s wife Rifaqah RA’s grave is also
                        located in the same compound next to his.Today, the area is known as Hebron, with the burial
                        places of Ibrahim AS and his family incorporated into a mosque known as Masjid Ibrahimi.</p>



                    <h2 id="Lut-AS">Prophet Lut AS</h2>
                    <p>Sayyidina Lut AS was the paternal nephew of Sayyidina Ibrahim AS who migrated to Palestine with
                        Prophet Ibrahim (Peace be upon him).
                    </p>
                    <p>They both departed from Egypt together, with Lut AS being tasked to go to the city of Sodom
                        (Sadum), which was on the western shore of the Dead Sea.</p>
                    <p>This city was filled with evil. Its residents waylaid, robbed and killed travelers. Another
                        common evil among them was that men had sex with men instead of with women. This unnatural act
                        later became known as sodomy (after the city of Sodom). It was practiced openly and unashamedly.
                    </p>
                    <p>It was at the height of these crimes and sins that Allah SWT revealed to Prophet Lut peace be
                        upon him that he should summon the people to give up their indecent behavior, but they were so
                        deeply sunk in their immoral habits that they were deaf to Lot’s preaching. Swamped in their
                        unnatural desires, they refused to listen, even when Lut warned them of Allah’s punishment.
                        Instead, they threatened to drive him out of the city if he kept on preaching.</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote py-3 px-3 py-sm-4 px-sm-4 my-4 my-sm-5">

                            When there was no hope of these people accepting Allah’s message, Prophet Lut AS prayed to
                            Allah: “My Lord! Save me and my family from what they do”
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-light-brown mt-3 mb-0">[Qur’aan 26:169]</p>

                    <p>Allah SWT surely saved him with his family except for his wife who was not one of the believers.
                    </p>
                    <p>After the Prophet left their land Allah’s most severe punishment came to the community wiping
                        them from the face of this earth. It is believed that the area where the Dead Sea is situated
                        today between modern-day Palestine and Jordan is the place where this community lived. One of
                        the punishments that befell them was of Sayyidina Jibreel AS carrying the whole piece of their
                        land high up in the sky and after flipping it upside down smashing them back on the earth. This
                        is a plausible explanation for the area of the Dead Sea being the lowest point on this earth.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lut AS proceeded towards Ibrahim AS who was situated deeper within Palestine. He visited him, and
                        when he recounted the story of his people, he was surprised to learn that Ibrahim AS already
                        knew of it. Lut AS along with Ibrahim AS continued to invite people to Allah SWT and fulfil
                        their Divinely ordained missions within the Blessed Land.</p>
                    <p>Prophet Lut AS’s tomb is located on the banks of the Gulf of Lut, in the centre of a small town
                        called Bani Na’im, close to the Dead Sea and five miles east of Al-Khaleel. There is also a
                        shrine dedicated to Lut (Peace be upon him) on the southeast of Bani Na’im known as the ‘Maqam
                        an Nabi Yatin’ (Shrine of the truthful Prophet). Local legend claims Lut (Peace be upon him)

                    <p>Ishaaq AS was the father of Ya’qoob (also known as Jacob or Israel) AS, who in turn was the
                        father of Yusuf (Joseph) AS.</p>
                    <p>Ya’qoob AS was born and lived in Palestine, as did all his offspring, including Yusuf AS.</p>
                    <p>However, when his brothers conspired against him and threw him in a well, Yusuf AS was sold into
                        slavery and ended up in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>After a number of trials there, Yusuf AS was appointed the finance minister of the country. On
                        encountering his brothers and hearing of the straitened circumstances they were facing in
                        Palestine, he revealed his identity to them and called for them all to come back to him along
                        with their father and entire family, to be resettled in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>This resettlement temporarily shifted the connection of Prophethood from the Holy Land to Egypt –
                        only to be re-established generations later.</p>
                    <p>Nonetheless, tradition has it, that after his death, Ya’qoob AS was brought back to Palestine and
                        buried in Al-Khalil(Hebron) according to his will. Yaqoub AS’s and his wife Leah’s (RA) tombs
                        are also located in the Ibraheemi Masjid</p>
                    <p>Historical accounts also mention that the well in which the brothers of Yusuf AS threw him in out
                        of jealousy is located near ‘Kibbutz Amiad’ in Galilee in Palestine. The site is known locally
                        as ‘Judd Yussuf’</p>



                    <h2 id="Yunus-AS">Prophet Yunus AS</h2>
                    <p>Sayyidina Yunus AS was a faithful Prophet of the Almighty from the offspring of Yaqub AS. He was
                        also addressed in the holy Quran as ‘Companion of the Fish’ because of the famous story of the
                        prophet being swallowed by a fish and being trapped inside its stomach for a number of days.
                        Allah SWT tells us in the Holy Quran how Prophet Yunus AS cried out to Him in the depths of the
                        darkness continuously praying “La ilaha illa anta, Subhanaka, Inni kuntu minaz-zalimin” (There
                        is none worthy of Worship besides You, You are far exalted and above all weaknesses, Surely, I
                        am from among the wrongdoers).</p>
                    <p>Despite being in such an unimaginable situation Yunus AS did not lose faith in Allah and hoped
                        for Allah’s mercy which surely did reach him, and the whale cast Yunus AS out on dry land. After
                        sometime Yunus AS was again blessed with good health and returned to his people to guide them
                        towards Allah’s message</p>
                    <p>The town Yunus AS was commanded to deliver the message of Allah SWT was called Nineveh, situated
                        on the right bank of the river Tigris in ancient Assyria, across the river from the modern-day
                        major city of Mosul, Iraq.</p>
                    <p>When Yunus AS departed from his people, it is said he stayed at Jaffa in Palestine and boarded a
                        ship to take him to Tirshish, where Tunisia is located today. It was during this journey that he
                        was thrown overboard and swallowed by the fish.</p>
                    <p>Yunus’s AS’s grave is said to be located in a city called Hulhul which is three miles north of
                        Al-Khaleel. The mosque built by the Ayyubids, that is said to house his grave, is built on Mount
                        Nabi Yunus, the highest peak in the West Bank, Palestine.</p>
                    <p>Yunus AS, however, is also claimed to be buried in Mosul, Iraq.</p>



                    <h2 id="Moosa-AS">Prophet Moosa AS</h2>
                    <p>However, by the time of Musa AS, the oppression meted out against them by the Pharaohs in Egypt
                        became unbearable.</p>
                    <p>The Qur’aan reminds us of the extent of this torment:</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote py-3 px-3 py-sm-4 px-sm-4 my-4 my-sm-5">

                            dreadful torment, slaughtering your sons and keeping your women. That was a severe test from
                            your Lord.”
                        </p>

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>In the wake of this, Sayyidina Moosa AS led the Bani Israeel in resistance against this slavery
                        and fled towards the Blessed Land of Palestine.</p>
                    <p>In a Divine Miracle, the Red Sea was parted for them enabling them to cross safely, whereas the
                        Pharaoh and his cronies who had pursued them perished when the sea returned to its normal state
                        immediately thereafter.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>It is here however that their insolence and ingratitude came into play, as they looked down upon
                        the unique source of sustenance Allah SWT had blessed them with and made all sorts of outrageous

                    <p>When Sayyidina Musa AS was summoned to a communion with his Lord, the Bani Israeel’s
                        transgression crossed all bounds. A golden calf was constructed and taken as an object of
                        worship, All efforts by Musa AS’s brother Harun AS to thwart this waywardness was also repelled.
                    </p>
                    <p>On his return, Musa AS took swift action to bring the culprits of this crime to book.</p>

                        again tarried in fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>Rather than exhibiting an eagerness to enter this sacred space, they responded to Musa AS’s

                    <p>For their obstinacy, the Bani Isra-eel were barred from entering the Holy Land for 40 years.
                        Instead they were rendered nomads wandering aimlessly in the Sinai desert. It was only after the
                        appointed duration has passed and the adults of the rebellious generation had passed on that the
                        trek into the Holy Land was completed.</p>
                    <p>Musa AS was left flabbergasted by the insolence of his nation, and he reached the end of his days
                        not having been able to fulfil his desire of reuniting with the Land of the Ambiyaa. The same
                        was the case of his brother, Haroon AS, who preceded him in death.</p>

                            Bukhari:</strong></p>
                    <p>Sayyidina Abu Hurayrah RA reports that the Prophet SAW said: “The angel of death was sent to
                        Musa[AS]. When he came to Musa, Musa slapped him on the eye. The angel returned to Allah SWT and
                        said, ‘You have sent me to a servant who does not want to die’. Allah SWT ordered the angel,
                        ‘Return to him and tell him to put his hand on the back of an ox and for every hair that will
                        come under it, he will be granted one year of life’. Musa AS said, ‘O Lord! What will happen
                        after that?’ Allah SWT replied, ‘Then death’. Musa [AS] decided, “Let it be now’. Musa[AS] then
                        requested Allah to let him die close to the Sacred Land, so much so that he would be at a
                        distance of a stone’s throw from it”.</p>
                    <p>Sayyidina Abu Hurayrah RA added that the Prophet SAW then said, “If I were there, I would show
                        you his grave, below the red sand hill on the side of the road”.</p>



                    <h2 id="Yusha-AS">Prophet Yusha AS</h2>
                    <p>When Sayyidina Musa AS passed away, the leadership of Bani Isra’eel passed to Yusha ibn Nun AS.

                    <p>Sayyidina Yusha ibn Nun is not mentioned directly in the Qur’an but he is the servant of Musa who
                        is referred to in the following verse of the Qur’an:</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote py-3 px-3 py-sm-4 px-sm-4 my-4 my-sm-5">

                    <p>The Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, mentions the name of Yusha ibn Nun as this servant of
                        Musa in a number of authentic narrations.</p>
                    <p>Being a servant of Musa he was close to the Revelation, close to the teacher (Musa) and he was a
                        righteous student of this teacher. And so, when Musa, ‘alayhis-salam, passed away, the
                        leadership of Bani Israeel was passed down to Yusha ibn Nun, and he became their Nabi.</p>
                    <p>Under the leadership of Yusha ibn Nun AS, the Bani Israeel were made victorious and returned to
                        the Holy Land of Shaam, an event which did not occur under Sayyidina Musa or Harun AS (who both
                        passed away whilst Bani Israeel were still in the wilderness).</p>
                    <p>The Prophet SAW informed us that none of those from the Bani Israeel who worshipped the golden
                        calf entered into Jerusalem. Hence, it was the new generation raised in freedom, and taught the
                        guidance of the Taurah by Musa and Harun AS, that accomplished the feat of returning to the Holy
                        Land.</p>
                    <p>On entry into the Holy Land, Sayyidina Yusha ibn Nun AS led the Children of Israeel against the
                        Jababirah who were a large giant-like people inhabiting the Land. The fighting was furious and
                        the sun was about to set. Sayyidina Yusha ibn Nun AS knew that he could not defeat these people
                        except if the day was longer as, if night came, the Jababirah would be able to regroup. So Yusha
                        pointed to the sun and said, “You are receiving orders and I am receiving orders from Allah, O
                        Allah stop the sun!”</p>
                    <p>Allah SWT, caused the sun to stop for Yusha ibn Nun until he defeated the people of Jerusalem.
                    </p>
                    <p>The full story of Yusha ibn Nun is told to us in a sahih hadith of the Prophet, sallallahu
                        ‘alayhi wa sallam, recorded in Sahih Muslim. The Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said:
                    </p>
                    <p>“One of the Prophets made a holy war. He said to his followers: One who has married a woman and
                        wants to consummate to his marriage but has not yet done so; another who has built a house but
                        has not yet erected its roof; and another who has bought goats and pregnant she-camels and is
                        waiting for their offspring-will not accompany me … ”</p>
                    <p>This Prophet did not want any person to come with him whose heart may be attached to anything
                        else. This is a Prophet who is not looking for numbers but rather for ikhlas (sincerity).</p>
                    <p>The Prophet Muhammad <span class="ar-unicode">&#xFDFA;</span>, continued:</p>
                    <p>” … So he marched on and approached a village at or about the time of the Asr prayers. He said to
                        the sun: You are receiving orders and I am receiving orders from Allah, O Allah stop the sun! It
                        was stopped for him until Allah granted him victory.”</p>
                    <p>We know this Prophet was Yusha ibn Nun AS because of a separate narration recorded by Imam Ahmad
                        in which the Prophet, sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said:</p>
                    <p>“The sun has never stopped for any man besides Yusha when he wanted to conquer Bayt al-Muqaddis.”

                    <h2 id="Dawood-AS">Prophet Dawood AS</h2>
                    <p>Sayyidina Dawud AS was a descendant of Judah, one of twelve sons of Sayyidina Ya’qub – who was
                        otherwise known as Israel. Sayyidina Dawud – who is known by the Jews and the Christians as the
                        Prophet David – was one of the many Prophets who were sent to the Children of Israel after
                        Sayyidina Musa AS in order to keep his teachings alive.</p>
                    <p>The references to Sayyidina Da’wud in the Qur’an do not describe his childhood. Historical
                        accounts claim he was born in Bethlehem, Palestine.</p>
                    <p>However, verses from Surah Al-Baqarah describe his killing the champion of the Philistines,
                        Jalut, who is more commonly known by the Jews and the Christians as Goliath. The Philistines
                        were at that stage the rulers of Palestine who dominated the Bani Israeel, who had found lodging
                        in the Holy Land after the demise of Musa AS.</p>
                    <p>The Quraanic passage begins by describing the appointment of Talut(King Saul) as the king of the
                        Children of Israel, by a Prophet of that time.</p>
                    <p>Although this Prophet is not named in the Qur’anic account he has been identified with the
                        Prophet who is known by the Jews and the Christians as the Prophet Samuel, while Talut has been
                        identified with King Saul, the first king of the Tribe of Israel, who was descended from
                        Binyamin (Benjamin) the son of Ya’qub, and who, it has been estimated, lived during the 11th
                        century BC. (Allah knows best)</p>
                    <p>With a small band of obedient soldiers, Talut met the larger and stronger army of Jalut. The men
                        put their faith in Allah, knowing that size and numbers were no match for a steadfast faith in
                        the power of Allah. Dawud , who was a very young man in Talut’s army, killed Jalut in legendary
                        fashion. After that, Jalut’s army fell apart, and the small band of Israelites was victorious.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sayyidina Da’wud AS succeeded Talut as king of the Children of Israeel, and during his rule all
                        the tribes of the Children of Israeel who had become divided were united again.</p>
                    <p>Dawud AS took up residence in Al Quds(Jerusalem), and continued his mission of calling to and
                        worshipping Allah SWT from its blessed environs.</p>

                    <p>Sayyidina Dawud AS also commenced the rebuilding of a place of worship at Masjid al Aqsa – upon

                        had initiated a reconstruction project.</p>

                    <p>Dawud AS – Prophet and King, Allah SWT’s vicegerent on earth – as described by the Qur’aan –
                        reigned over the Children of Israeel for 40 years, from approximately 1018 BC to 978 BC.</p>
                    <p>Some accounts claim his tomb is located just outside the old city of Al-Quds on Jabel Sahyoun
                        (Mount Zion). But, there remains a difference of opinion on whether this is the tomb of Dawud AS
                        or simply a Maqam where he once stayed.</p>
                    <p>It should be considered, that whilst, for many Jews and Christians, the affiliation with
                        Jerusalem begins with the inception of the Kingdom of David and his contruction of Masjid al
                        Aqsa(referred to as the Temple); for Muslims, the contributions of Dawud AS towards the Blessed
                        Land are seen as a continuation of a sacred trend that has its origins right at the onset of
                        humanity and Prophethood.</p>

                        winds and understand and talk to birds and animals. Allah SWT directed him to teach both men and
                        jinns to mine the earth and extract its minerals to make tools and weapons. He also favored him
                        with a mine of copper, which was a rare metal in those days.

                        SWT. Then Allah the Exalted ordained for him to die. His life and death were full of wonders and
                        miracles; thus, his death harmonized with his life and glory. His death, like his life, was
                        unique. The people had to learn that the future is known neither by the jinns, nor by the
                        prophets, but by Allah alone.</p>
                    <p>Sulayman AS’s effort in this direction did not end with his life, for even his death became an
                        example. He was sitting holding his staff, overseeing the jinns at work. He died sitting in this
                        position. For a long time no one was aware of his death, for he was seen sitting erect. The
                        jinns continued with their sand toil, thinking that Sulayman AS was watching over them.</p>
                    <p>Many days later, a hungry ant began nibbling Sulayman AS’s staff. It continued to do so, eating
                        the lower part of the staff, until it fell out of Solomon’s hand, and his great body fell to the
                        ground. People hurried to him, realizing that he had died a long time ago and that the jinns did
                        not perceive the unseen, for had the jinns known the unseen, they would not have kept working,
                        thinking that Sulayman AS was alive.</p>

                    <h2 id="Zakariyyah-and-Yahya-AS">Prophet Zakariyyah and Yahya AS</h2>
                    <p>Sayyidina Zakariyya(Zachariah) AS was an illustrious Prophet of the Bani Israeel. He was one of
                        the descendants of Prophet Sulaiman AS. The name of his wife was al-Yashbi’ who belonged to the
                        family of Prophet Harun AS. The Prophet Zakariya AS was the patron of Mariam, the mother of
                        Prophet Isa AS. And he was the Imam of Masjid al Aqsa.</p>
                    <p>The Prophet AS kept the true teachings of Sayyidina Musa AS alive. He used to pray devotionally
                        and preach zealously at Masjid al Aqsa. His wife and he were the symbols of piety and
                        righteousness.</p>
                    <p>His one disappointment in life was that he had no children, for his wife was barren. This worried
                        him, for he feared there was no one after him to carry out his work, and hold the leadership of
                        Masjid al Aqsa after his passing. The people needed a strong leader, for it they were left on
                        their own, they would move away from Allah’s teachings and change the Holy Laws to suit
                        themselves.</p>
                    <p>During one of his visits to Masjid al Aqsa, he went to check on Mariam AS, who was living in a
                        secluded room of the sanctuary. He was surprised to find fresh out of season fruit in her room.
                        Besides him, no one had entry to her room. When he inquired of its origin, she told him that the
                        fruit was from Allah. She found it every morning. But why was he so surprised, she asked him.
                        Did he not know that Allah provides without measure for whom He wills?</p>
                    <p>This noble woman opened his eyes to a startling idea. Could he not ask his Lord to bless him with
                        a child in his old age? Even if his wife was past childbearing age, nothing was impossible for
                        his Gracious Lord!</p>
                    <p>Allah the Almighty speaks of what transpired in Chapters 3 and 19 of the Noble Qur’aan:</p>
                    <p><strong>‘Kaf, Ha, Ya, Ain, Sad,</strong> (These letters are one of the miracles of the Quran, and
                        none but Allah Alone knows their meanings). This is a mention of the Mercy of your Lord to His
                        slave Zakariyah. When he called out his Lord (Allah) – a call in secret, saying: “My Lord!
                        Indeed my bones have grown feeble, and gray hair has spread on my head, and I have never been
                        unblest in my invocation to You, O my Lord! And Verily! I fear my relatives after me, since my
                        wife is barren. So give me from Yourself an heir, – who shall inherit me, and inherit also the
                        posterity of Jacob (inheritance of the religious knowledge and Prophethood, not the wealth,
                        etc.) And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are Well-pleased!”</p>
                    <p>Allah said: “O Zakariyah! Verily, We give you the glad tidings of a son. His name will be Yahya
                        (John). We have given that name to none before him.”</p>
                    <p>He said: “My Lord! How can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I have reached the extreme
                        old age.”</p>
                    <p>He said: “So (it will be). Your Lord says, It is easy for Me. Certainly I have created you
                        before, when you had been nothing.”</p>
                    <p>Zakariyah said: “My Lord! Appoint for me a sign.”</p>
                    <p>He said: “Your sign is that you shall not speak unto mankind for three nights, though having no
                        bodily defect.”</p>
                    <p>Then he came out to his people from Al Mihrab (a praying place or a private room, etc.), he told
                        them by signs to glorify Allah’s Praises in the morning and in the afternoon.</p>

                    <p>The Mihrab(niche) where Zakariyya AS implored Allah SWT to grant his needs and the location where
                        he was blessed with the glad tidings is situated at Masjid al Aqsa.</p>
                    <p>Yahya AS was born six months before Isa (upon him be peace). His mother was the sister of Hanna,
                        who was the mother of Maryam (upon her be peace).</p>
                    <p>Yahya AS was a devout servant of Allah SWT, who was selfless and cried easily. Allah guided him
                        to read the Book of Jurisprudence closely; thus, he became the wisest and most knowledgeable man
                        of that time. Therefore, Allah the Almighty endowed him with the faculties of passing judgments
                        on people’s affairs, interpreting the secrets of religion, guiding people to the right path, and
                        warning them against the wrong one.</p>
                    <p>The Prophet Zakariyya AS felt satisfied as his son grew up and became a symbol of piety. He was
                        graced with wisdom, obedience and asceticism.</p>
                    <p>The Prophet Zakariyya AS continued preaching the religion of Allah even in old age. Yahya AS also
                        called to Allah SWT ceaselessly.</p>
                    <p>The Bani Israeel however persisted in mischief making and wickedness. They not only ignored the
                        teachings of these Prophets of Allah but tortured them too.</p>
                    <p>As a result both Zakariyya and Yahya AS were killed, in separate crimes.</p>
                    <p>Legend has it that a small structure within the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus houses the head of
                        Yahya AS, who was beheaded. Zakariyya AS’s burial place is also said to be located in Syria.</p>




                    <h2 id="Isa-and-Maryam-AS">Prophet Isa and Maryam AS</h2>
                    <p>The Prophet Zakariyya AS’s wife’s sister had a daughter named Hannah. She was married to Imran, a
                        leader of the Bani Israeel. For many years, the couple remained childless. Whenever Hannah saw
                        another woman with a child, her longing for a baby increased. Although years had passed, she
                        never lost hope. She believed that one day Allah would bless her with a child, on whom she would
                        shower all her motherly love.</p>
                    <p>She turned to the Lord of the heavens and the earth and pleaded with Him for a child. She would
                        offer the child in the service of Allah’s house, the Masjid al Aqsa in Jerusalem. Allah granted
                        her request. When she learned that she was pregnant, she was the happiest woman alive, and
                        thanked Allah for His gift. Her overjoyed husband Imran also thanked Allah for His mercy.</p>

                            However, while she was pregnant her husband passed away. Hannah wept bitterly. Alas, Imran
                            did not live to see their child for whom they had so longed. She gave birth to a girl, and
                            again turned to Allah in prayer: “O my Lord, I have delivered a female child,” and the male
                            is not like the female, and I have named her Mary, and I seek refuge with You (Allah) for
                            her and her offspring from Satan, the outcast.”

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Hannah had a big problem in reference to her promise to Allah, for females were not accepted into
                        Masjid al Aqsa at that stage and she was very worried. Her sister’s husband Zakariyah AS,
                        comforted her, saying that Allah knew best what she had delivered and appreciated fully what she
                        had offered in His service. She wrapped the baby in a shawl and handed it over to the Masjid
                        elders. As the baby was a girl, the question of her guardianship posed a problem for the elders.
                        This was a child of their late and beloved leader, and everyone was eager to take care of her.
                        Zakariyah AS said to the elders: “I am the husband of her maternal aunt and her nearest relation
                        at the Masjid; therefore, I will be more mindful of her than all of you.”</p>
                    <p>As it was their custom to draw lots to solve disagreements, they followed this course. Each one
                        was given a reed to throw into the river. They had agreed that whoever’s reed remained afloat
                        would be granted guardianship of the girl. All the reeds sank to the bottom except Zakariyah’s.
                        With this sign, they all surrendered to the will of Allah and made him the guardian.</p>
                    <p>To ensure that no one had access to Mariam AS, Zakariyah built a separate room for her at Masjid
                        al Aqsa. As she grew up, she spent her time in devotion to Allah. Zakariyah AS visited her daily
                        to see to her needs, and so it continued for many years. One day, he was surprised to find fresh
                        fruit, which was out of season in her room. As he was the only person who could enter her room,
                        he asked her how the fruit got there. She replied that these provisions were from Allah, as He
                        gives to whom He wills. Zakariyah understood by this that Allah had raised Mariam AS’s status
                        above that of other women.</p>
                    <p>Allah SWT makes mention of this in the Qur’aan:</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote py-3 px-3 py-sm-4 px-sm-4 my-4 my-sm-5">
                        <p class="mb-0">
                            “So her Lord accepted her with good acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and
                            put her in the care of Zakariyyah(Zechariah). Every time Zechariah entered upon her in the
                            prayer chamber, he found with her provision. He said, “O Mariam(Mary), from where is this
                            [coming] to you?” She said, “It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills
                            without account.””
                        </p>

                    <p>Thereafter, Zakariyah AS spent more time with her, teaching and guiding her. Mariam AS grew to be
                        a devotee of Allah, glorifying Him day and night. “</p>

                    <p>The angel’s visit caused Mariam AS great anxiety, which increased as the months went by. How
                        could she face giving birth to a child without having a husband? Later, she felt life kicking
                        inside her. With a heavy heart, she left Masjid al Aqsa and went to Nazareth, a city of
                        Palestine, in an attempt to avoid the public.</p>
                    <p>But fear and anxiety did not leave her. She was from a noble and pious family. Her father had not
                        been an evil man nor was her mother an impure woman. How could she prevent tongues from wagging
                        about her honor?</p>
                    <p>Later, she was overtaken by the pains of childbirth. She saw down against a dry palm tree, and
                        here she gave birth to a son. Looking at her beautiful baby, she was hurt that she had brought
                        him into the world without a father. She exclaimed: “I wish I had died before this happened and
                        had vanished into nothingness!”</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, she heard a voice nearby: “Grieve not, your Lord has placed a rivulet below, and shake
                        the trunk of this tree, from which ripe dates will fall. So eat and drink and regain the
                        strength you have lost; and be of good cheer, for what you see is the power of Allah, Who made
                        the dry palm tree regain life, in order to provide food for you.” For a while she was comforted
                        by Allah’s miracle, for it was a sure sign of her innocence and purity.</p>
                    <p>She decided to return to the city. As she had expected, her arrival in the city with a newborn
                        baby in her arms aroused the curiosity of the people. They scolded her: “This is a terrible sin
                        that you have committed.” She put her finger to her lips and pointed to the child. They asked:
                        “How can we speak to a newborn baby?” To their total amazement, the child began to speak
                        clearly: “I am Allah’s servant. Allah has given me the Book, and has made me a prophet, and has
                        blessed me wherever I may be, and has enjoined on me prayers and alms-giving as long as I live.
                        Allah has made me dutiful towards she who had borne me. He has not made me arrogant nor
                        unblessed. Peace unto me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I shall be raised
                        alive.”</p>
                    <p>Most of the people realized that the baby was unique, for it Allah wills something, He merely
                        says “Be” and it happens. Of course, there were some who regarded the baby’s speech as a strange
                        trick, but at least Mariam AS could now stay in Nazareth without being harassed.</p>
                    <p>Allah the Exalted revealed: “And mention in the Book (the Qur’an, O Muhammad, the story of) Mary,
                        when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east. She placed a screen (to
                        screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Ruh (angel Gabriel), and he appeared before
                        her in the form of a man in all respects.</p>
                    <p>“She said: “Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Beneficent (Allah) from you, if you do fear
                        Allah.”</p>
                    <p>The angel said: “I am only a Messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a
                        righteous son.”</p>
                    <p>“She said: “How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?” He said: “So
                        (it will be), your Lord said: “That is easy for Me (Allah): and (We wish) to appoint him as a
                        sign to mankind and a mercy from Us (Allah), and it is a matter (already) decreed, (by Allah).'”
                    </p>
                    <p>“So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place (Bethlehem valley, about four to
                        six miles from Jerusalem). And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree.
                        She said: “Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight!”</p>
                    <p>“Then (the babe “Jesus” or Gabriel) cried unto her from below her, saying: “Grieve not! Your Lord
                        has provided you a water stream under you; and shake the trunk of palm tree towards you, it will
                        let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. So eat and drink and be glad, and if you see any human
                        being, say: ‘Verily! I have vowed a fast unto the Most Beneficent (Allah) so I shall not speak
                        to any human being this day.'”</p>
                    <p>“Then she brought him (the baby) to her people, carrying him. They said: “O Mary! Indeed you have
                        brought a thing Fariyya (an unheard mighty thing). O sister (the like) of Aaron (not the brother
                        of Moses, but he was another pious man at the time of Mary)! Your father was not a man who used
                        to commit adultery, nor was your mother an unchaste woman.”</p>
                    <p>“Then she pointed to him. They said: “How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?”</p>
                    <p>He (Jesus) said: “Verily! I am a slave of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a
                        Prophet; and He has made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined me prayer, and Zakat, as
                        long as I live, and dutiful to my mother, and made me not arrogant, unblest. And Salam (peace)
                        be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!”</p>
                    <p>“Such is Jesus, son of Mary. (It is) a statement of truth, about which they doubt (or dispute).
                        It befits not (the Majesty of) Allah that He should beget a son (this refers to the slander of
                        Christians against Allah, by saying that Jesus is the son of Allah). Glorified (and Exalted be
                        He above all that they associate with Him). When He decrees a thing, He only says to it, “Be!” –
                        and it is.</p>
                    <p>“Jesus said: “And verily Allah is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him (Alone). That is the
                        Straight Path. (Allah’s Religion of Islamic Monotheism which He did ordain for all of His
                        Prophets).”</p>
                    <p>Then the sects differed (the Christians about Jesus), so woe unto the disbeliveers (those who
                        gave false witness saying that Jesus is the son of Allah) from the meeting of a great Day (the

                    <p>The entire journey was a complete bodily experience with the Messenger of Allah SAW being in a

                            had never before been as uneasy as I
                            was at the time they interrogated me. Though I had seen Bayt al Maqdis in the Isra, I could
                            not recollect in detail the exact description. However, Allah SWT revealed before my very
                            eyes an image of Bayt al Maqdis and thereafter I was immediately able to answer the
                            questions the Quraysh of Makkah asked me”
                        </p>

                            Al-Hijr and Allah displayed Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem in front of me, and I began describing
                            it to them while I was looking at it”)

                    </blockquote>
                    <p>In his book Dala’il An-Nubuwwah, Al-Hafiz Abu Nuaym al-Isbahani recorded via Muhammad bin ‘Umar
                        Al-Waqidi who said: Malik bin Abi Ar-Rajjal told me from ‘Amr bin Abdullah that Muhammad bin
                        Ka’b Al-Qurazi said: “The Messenger of Allaah (SAW) sent Dihyah bin Khalifah to Caesar.” He
                        mentioned how he came to him, and described an incident that showed how wise Caesar was. He sent
                        for the Arab merchants who were in Syria and Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb and his companions were
                        brought to him. He asked them the well-known questions that were recorded by Al-Bukhari and
                        Muslim, as we shall discuss below, and Abu Sufyan tried hard to give the impression that this
                        was an insignificant issue.</p>

                    <p>[The narrator] said that Abu Sufyan [later] said: “By Allaah,
                        nothing stopped me from saying something to Heraclius to make him despise [Muhammad] but the
                        fact that I did not want to tell a lie that would later be found out, and he would never believe
                        me again after that. Then I told him about the night on which he was taken to the Night Journey.
                        I said: ‘O King, shall I not tell you of something from which you will know that he is lying? He
                        said, “What is it?” I said: ‘He claims that he went out of our land, the land of Al-Haram, in
                        one night, and came to your sanctuary in Jerusalem, then came back to us the same night, before
                        morning came.’ The Patriarch of Jerusalem was there, standing next to Caesar. The Patriarch of
                        Jerusalem said: ‘I know that night.’ Caesar looked at him and said, ‘How do you know about
                        this?’ He said, ‘I never used to sleep at night until I closed all the doors of the sanctuary.
                    </p>

                    <p>On that night I closed all the doors except for one, which I could not manage to close. I asked
                        my workers and others who were with me to help me deal with it, but we couldn’t move it. It was
                        like trying to move a mountain. So I called the carpenters, and they looked at it and said: The
                        lintel and some part of the structure have fallen onto it. We cannot move it until morning, when
                        we will be able to see what the problem is. So I went back and left those two doors open. The
                        next morning I went back, and saw that the stone at the corner of the sanctuary had a hole in
                        it, and said to my companions: This door has not been closed last night except for a Prophet,
                        who prayed last night in our sanctuary.”</p>

                    <p>Al Mubarakpuri in the Sealed Nectar comments on the opening verses of Surah al Isra, which
                        describe the Prophet Muhammad <span class="ar-unicode">&#xFDFA;</span>’s glorious night journey
                        to Jerusalem, and then quickly
                        transition to uncover the shameful deeds and crimes of the Bani Israeel, as being indicative of
                        an important symbolic role of the Mi’raj:</p>
                    <p>“Jerusalem was the first scene of the Night Journey, and here lies the message directed to the
                        Jews and which clearly suggested that they would be removed from the office of leadership of
                        mankind due to the crimes they had committed, which no longer justified the occupation of that
                        office.</p>
                    <p>“The message suggested significantly that the office of leadership would be taken over by Allah’s
                        Messenger SAW to hold in his hand both the headquarters of the Abrahamic faith, the Sacred
                        Mosque in Makkah and the Farthest Mosque in Jerusalem. It was high time for the spiritual
                        authority to be transferred from a nation whose history was pregnant with treachery,
                        covenant-breaching and aggression to another nation blessed with piety, and dutifulness to
                        Allah, with a Messenger who enjoys the privilege of the Qur’anic Revelation, which leads to what
                        is best and right”.</p>
