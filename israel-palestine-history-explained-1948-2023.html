                        Israel-Palestine history is marked by decades of struggle, wars, oppression, and the ongoing
                        occupation of Palestine. We trace the roots of this deep-seated dispute, highlighting the
                        significant events that have shaped the region. This history is filled with resistance,
                        resilience, and the unyielding spirit of a people striving for their rights and dignity.

                    <p>
                        During World War I, Britain issued the Balfour Declaration, which was a pledge to
                        establish “a national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine. This declaration became one
                        of
                        the main catalysts for the Nakba – the genocide of Palestine in 1948 – and the
                        subsequent conflict with the state of Israel​​.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Content and Implications</h3>
                    <p>
                        The declaration, issued by British Foreign Secretary <strong>Arthur Balfour</strong> to
                        Lionel Walter <strong>Rothschild</strong>, a leader of the British Jewish community, included a
                        caveat that
                        “nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing
                        non-Jewish
                        communities in Palestine.” However, this statement was in contradiction with previous
                        promises
                        made by Britain to Arabs and the French, and it set the stage for Palestine to come under
                        British occupation without granting independence to Palestinian Arabs.

                            The Balfour Declaration promised a national home for Jews in Palestine, where at that time,
                            Jews made up only about <strong>6 percent</strong> of the total population, while the native
                            Arabs constituted about 94%.

                    <h2 id="british-mandate">British Mandate Palestine</h2>
                    <p>
                        The British Mandate system, viewed as a form of colonialism, began to facilitate the
                        immigration
                        of European Jews to Palestine. The mandate aimed to create the conditions for the
                        establishment
                        of a Jewish national home in a territory where Jews were a minority at the time​.
                    </p>
                    <figure class="fancy-box text-center mb-4 border">
                        <img data-src="https://masjidalaqsa.b-cdn.net/assets/images/articles/israel-palestine-history/british-mandate/hd/palestine-before-british-mandate-1947.png"

                    </figure>

                    <h3>Palestinian Opposition</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Palestinian Arabs strongly opposed the Balfour Declaration and the British support for
                        the
                        Zionist project. In 1919, the King-Crane Commission found that the majority of Palestinians
                        were
                        against Zionism. The Third Palestinian Congress in Haifa in 1920 rejected the declaration as
                        a
                        violation of international law and the rights of the indigenous population​​.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Tensions and Revolt</h3>
                    <p>
                        Increased Jewish immigration under the mandate led to tensions and violence between
                        Palestinian
                        Arabs and European Jews. One of the first notable responses was the Nebi Musa revolt in
                        1920​​.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Allied Powers’ Involvement</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Balfour Declaration was issued with the prior approval of other Allied powers during
                        World
                        War I. The United States and France played roles in supporting the declaration, with France
                        expressing its support for Jewish colonization in Palestine before the issuance of the
                        Balfour
                        Declaration.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Jewish Immigration to Palestine</h3>
                    <p>
                        Between 1920 and 1946, an estimated 375,415 Jews arrived in Palestine, mostly from Europe,
                        according to British records.
                    </p>

                    <p>The Nakba ("<strong>catastrophe</strong>" in Arabic) in 1948 marked a period of profound tragedy
                        for the
                        Palestinian people, coinciding with the establishment of the Israeli occupation. It was
                        characterized by brutal massacres, destruction, and mass displacement.</p>
                    <h3>Zionism Emergence</h3>
                    <p>Zionism, emerging in late 19th-century Eastern Europe, envisioned a
                        Jewish state, leading to significant Jewish migration to Palestine. Theodor Herzl's 1896
                        publication, "<strong>Der Judenstaat</strong>" ("The Jewish State"), was pivotal in this
                        movement.</p>
                    <h3>UN Plan</h3>
                    <p>In 1947, following the end of WWII and the British decision to end their mandate, the
                        newly formed UN adopted Resolution 181, recommending the partition of Palestine into Jewish
                        and Arab states. It was viewed as a <strong>Zionist occupation plan</strong> because it heavily
                        skewed in
                        favor
                        of
                        the Jewish population, disproportionately allocating approximately <strong>56% of historic
                            Palestine</strong>
                        to
                        the Jewish people, igniting tension between Palestinian Arab civilians and Zionists
                        groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Arabs rejected the plan as it was unfair to the native population and irrational at the very
                        least. Additionally, the zionists did not
                        adhere
                        to the proposed UN plan and proceeded to capture the most of the Palestine during the
                        Nakba through barbaric means.</p>

                    <h3>Early Massacres</h3>
                    <p>Before the official start of the Nakba, Jewish armed groups had already begun
                        the process of genocide. Infamous massacres such as Balad al-Shaykh, Sa'sa', and
                        Deir
                        Yassin, where hundreds of Palestinians were killed, were precursors to the larger-scale
                        atrocities of the Nakba.</p>
                    <h4>Balad al-Shaykh Attack (December 1947)</h4>
                    <p>More than 60 people were killed in an attack by
                        Haganah units on the village of Balad al-Shaykh, which houses the tomb of the martyr
                        Izzeddin
                        al-Qassam.</p>
                    <h4>Operation Nachshon (1 April 1948)</h4>
                    <p>This operation, carried out by Palmach units, aimed to
                        seize territory in the rural plateaus on the western slopes of the Jerusalem mountains. It
                        culminated in the occupation of several villages and the Deir Yasin massacre, where more
                        than
                        100 men, women, and children were killed.</p>
                    <h4>Deir Yassin Massacre (9 April 1948)</h4>
                    <p>On April 9, 1948, over 110 Palestinians in Deir Yassin were
                        killed by Zionist/Jewish forces in one of the most notorious massacres of the Nakba.
                        Preceded
                        by political and military developments, including a rivalry within the Zionist movement, the
                        massacre involved brutal methods by Zionist forces, including indiscriminate killings and
                        desecration of bodies. Many victims were women and children, and the survivors were paraded
                        through Jerusalem before being executed or killed in the village.</p>
                    <h3>The Establishment of Israel / Apartheid State (14 May 1948)</h3>
                    <p>On May 14, 1948, the State of Israel was declared, leading to further mass expulsions and
                        killings of Palestinians. Hundreds of Zionist arms groups opened fire at thousands of
                        Palestinian
                        civilians, including women and children, causing great suffering.</p>

                    <h4>Al-Tantura Massacre (22 May 1948)</h4>
                    <p>Israeli forces carried out a massacre in the village of Al Tantura, resulting in an estimated
                        230
                        deaths. There were instances of <strong class="highlight-red">extreme violence, including
                            sexual
                            assault</strong> — many women were raped and brutally
                        murdered.
                        Recorded testimonies from Jewish soldiers, revealing the extent of these atrocities, have
                        been
                        exhibited, providing firsthand accounts of these events.</p>

                    <h4>Dani / Lydda-Ramla Massacres (July 1948)</h4>
                    <p>Operations like Dani resulted in the mass killing and
                        expulsion of Palestinians from cities like Lydda and Ramla, in what has been described as
                        one of
                        the largest acts of genocide carried out by Israeli forces.</p>
                    <p>The Lydda-Ramla Massacre, occurring between July 9 and 13, 1948, happened in two stages:
                        initially during the occupation of the city and subsequently during a mass expulsion
                        operation,
                        considered a significant act of ethnic cleansing by Israeli forces. In one instance, Israeli
                        soldiers
                        opened fire on residents fleeing their homes, leading to corpses piling up in the streets.
                    </p>
                    <p>Those who sought refuge in the Dahmash Mosque were also shot. Estimates suggest that more
                        than
                        400 people died within the city, and the total number of deaths, including those during the
                        forced march, approached one thousand.</p>

                    <h4>Al-Dawayima Massacre (October 1948)</h4>
                    <p>Occurring on October 29, 1948, it was one of the
                        major and most horrific massacres during the Nakba. Unlike earlier massacres by Zionist
                        paramilitary groups, this was executed by regular armed forces of the newly established
                        state
                        of Israel. The soldiers of the 89th commando battalion, part of the Israeli army's 8th
                        Armored
                        Brigade, launched an assault from three directions on the village, overwhelming the minimal
                        resistance.</p>
                    <p>Villagers were targeted in their homes, the village mosque, and a cave in Tor
                        al-Zagh
                        area. Eyewitness accounts describe brutal killings, including the elderly and children. The
                        American consul in Jerusalem wrote in his report that based on the news that had reached
                        him,
                        between 500 and 1,000 Palestinians were killed.</p>

                    <div class="focus-section red">
                        <p>During this period, over 750,000 Palestinians were displaced, around 530 villages and
                            cities
                            were destroyed, over 125,000 homes were demolished, and over <strong>15,000 Palestinian
                                civilians</strong>
                            were killed, clearly marking a genocide.

                    <h2 id="post-nakba">Post Nakba</h2>
                    <p>Following the Nakba in 1948, a significant phase of expansion and consolidation began for
                        Israel, profoundly altering the geopolitical landscape of the region. This period, marked by
                        conflict, displacement, and forced territorial acquisition, set the stage for the ongoing
                        Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
                    <h3>Initial Occupation of Palestine (1948-1967)</h3>
                    <h4>Arab-Israeli War (1948-49)</h4>
                    <p>In the wake of the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, Israel
                        established control over 78% of historic Palestine, significantly more than the plan that UN
                        had
                        proposed. This expansion was enforced through military means, often committing numerous
                        massacres. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians became refugees in their own land. Many
                        Arab nations,
                        including Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq, supported Palestine and confronted Zionists armed
                        groups. Despite their efforts, the
                        Zionists forces occupied substantial territories throughout Palestine.</p>
                    <h4>Border Tensions and Murders</h4>
                    <p>The following years saw persistent tensions along Israeli
                        borders, especially with Syria and Jordan. Thousands of Palestinian refugees tried to
                        return, leading to clashes and reprisals. Israel's response was brutal, with estimates
                        suggesting about <strong class="highlight-red">5,000 people were relentlessly
                            killed</strong>
                        trying
                        to cross the borders from
                        1949 to 1956.</p>
                    <h4>Qibya Massacre (1953)</h4>
                    <p>One of the most infamous incidents was the Qibya massacre in
                        the West Bank, where Israeli occupation forces destroyed over 45 houses, and a mosque and a
                        school, and killed
                        at least 67 Palestinians. The number of village inhabitants was about 200 on the day of the
                        massacre.</p>
                    <p>The Israeli occupation forces bombed houses with people inside, leading to tragic outcomes. Among
                        the most
                        heart-wrenching scenes was a woman sitting amidst rubble, under which the <strong>small limbs of
                            her six children</strong> were visible. Nearby, her husband's body, fragmented by gunfire,
                        lay in the street.
                        This incident encapsulates the harrowing impact of the conflict on civilians.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Suez Crisis (1956)</h4>
                    <p>Israel, alongside Britain and France, invaded Egypt during the Suez
                        Crisis, aiming to topple Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, after the nationalization
                        of the Suez Canal.</p>
                    <h3>The Rise of Palestinian Resistance</h3>
                    <h4>Fedayeen Movement</h4>
                    <p>The 1950s and 1960s witnessed the rise of the Fedayeen,
                        Palestinian armed resistance groups aimed to liberate Palestine from zionist occupation
                        and oppression.</p>
                    <h4>As Samu' Raid (1966)</h4>
                    <p>In response to a Fatah attack, Israel conducted a large military
                        attack on the West Bank village of As Samu', killing and wounding numerous Palestinian
                        civilians and demolishing homes.</p>

                    <h2 id="six-day-war">The Six-Day War (1967)</h2>
                    <p>Disputes over the use of Jordan River water and border cultivation heightened tensions
                        between Israel and Egypt along with Syria. The war began after <strong>Israel attacked
                            Egypt</strong> on June 5, 1967.</p>
                    <h4>Territorial Gains and Occupation</h4>
                    <p>In the Six-Day War, Israel occupied significant
                        territories including the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights,
                        and the Sinai Peninsula. This expansion in Israeli territory was significant and brought a
                        large Palestinian population under direct zionist cruel control.</p>
                    <h4>Displacement and Demolitions</h4>
                    <p>The war led to the displacement of another <strong class="highlight-red">413,000
                            Palestinians</strong>. In Jerusalem, the Moroccan Quarter was demolished to create the
                        Western
                        Wall Plaza, causing further displacement of Palestinian families.</p>
                    <h3>Casualties</h3>
                    <p>The conflict led to widespread losses among the Arab nations. Egypt suffered
                        between 9,800 to 15,000 killed, Syria had approximately 1,000 to 2,500 killed, and
                        Jordan reported 696 to 700 killed, compared with about 700 for Israel. These numbers
                        include both militants and civilians. And it's reported that around 1,953 Palestinian
                        civilians were also killed.</p>
                    <h3>Post-War Settlement Expansion</h3>
                    <p>Following the war, Israel began establishing settlements in the
                        occupied territories, a move seen as defying international law. This settlement
                        expansion was a significant factor in heightening tensions between Israelis and
                        Palestinians. Jews were landing from
                        various countries, and the Israeli army helped them with arms support to forcefully
                        displace Palestinians and take their homes. This included settlements in the West Bank,
                        Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
                    <h3>Israeli Military Developments</h3>
                    <p>The occupied Palestinian territories were placed under direct
                        Israeli military control, leading to restrictions on Palestinian movement and civil rights.
                        The
                        continuous expansion of settlements and military
                        occupation led to growing resentment and opposition among Palestinians, setting the
                        stage for organized resistance.</p>
                    <h3>The Emergence of the Palestinian National Movement</h3>
                    <p>During this period, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) emerged
                        as a prominent voice for Palestinian national aspirations. The PLO's increasing influence
                        and calls for an independent Palestinian state gained traction both regionally and
                        internationally. It was more of a politicized struggle, advocating for national and human
                        rights and recognition on the global stage.</p>

                        between Israel, Egypt, and Syria. It began when Egypt and Syria launched an attack on Israel
                        during the Yom Kippur holiday to regain the territories that Israel had seized in the
                        Six-Day
                        War of 1967.</p>
                    <h3>Goals of Egypt and Syria</h3>
                    <p>The President of Egypt, Anwar Sadat, had initially sought a limited
                        conflict to reignite stalled peace talks, while the President of Syria, Assad aimed to
                        reclaim
                        the
                        Golan Heights lost to Israel in 1967.</p>
                    <h3>International Involvement and Resolution</h3>
                    <p>The war's turning point came with the involvement
                        of global superpowers - the USSR and the USA, who supplied arms to their respective allies.
                        A
                        significant move by the Arab nations during the conflict was to impose an oil embargo on the
                        US, pressuring it to support a ceasefire. The war ended with the UN Security Council passing
                        Resolution 338, calling for a ceasefire and the implementation of Resolution 242, which
                        demanded Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories.</p>
                    <h3>Casualties</h3>
                    <p>Although the exact numbers for the Yom Kippur War are not
                        confirmed, it's estimated that 15,000 Egyptian, and 3,500 Syrian died, and 2,521 Israeli
                        soldiers
                        died. Iraq lost 278 killed and 898 wounded, while Jordan suffered 23 killed and 77 wounded.
                    </p>
                    <p>These casualties are of soliders. The civilian ones are unknown.</p>
                    <h3>Post-War Developments</h3>
                    <p>Post-war, the conflict led to the Camp David Accords between Egypt
                        and Israel, brokered by US President Jimmy Carter. These accords established peace between
                        the two nations but left unresolved issues regarding Palestinian refugees and the status of
                        Jerusalem. Egypt's peace treaty with Israel resulted in its temporary expulsion from the
                        Arab
                        League and a break in diplomatic relations with other Arab nations. This war, thus, had a
                        profound impact on Middle Eastern geopolitics and the trajectory of the Israeli-Palestinian
                        conflict.</p>
                    <h3>Prelude to the First Intifada</h3>
                    <h4>Growing Frustrations</h4>
                    <p>By the mid-1980s, the ongoing settlement expansion,
                        indiscriminate killing of civilians, and lack of progress in resolving the Palestinian issue
                        had significantly increased frustrations among Palestinians.</p>
                    <h4>Local Organizing</h4>
                    <p>Grassroots organizing began to take shape in Palestinian communities,
                        laying the groundwork for a more coordinated and widespread uprising.</p>

                    <p>The Sabra and Shatila massacre remains one of the most harrowing events in the history of the
                        Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In September 1982, in the midst of Lebanon's civil war and the
                        Israeli invasion of Lebanon, an <strong>unbelievable massacre</strong> unfolded in two
                        Palestinian
                        refugee camps, Sabra
                        and Shatila, on the outskirts of Beirut.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) had surrounded Beirut as part of their invasion of Lebanon with
                        the
                        aim of expelling the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Despite an established ceasefire
                        and the subsequent evacuation of the PLO leadership and
                        fighters from Beirut, the <strong>Israel broke the ceasefire</strong>
                        agreement and procedeed to occupy the city, including the neighborhoods encompassing Sabra and
                        Shatila.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Atrocities Unfold</h3>
                    <p>On 16 September 1982, four months after Israel invaded Lebanon, the far-right Lebanese Phalange
                        militia stormed the two densely populated refugee camps in Beirut. Israeli soldiers were ordered
                        to allow them into the camps and to seal all exits <strong>so no one could escape</strong>.</p>

                    <p>For the next 40 hours, they carried out a <strong>systematic slaughter
                            of civilians</strong>, <strong class="highlight-red">killing about 3,500 civilians</strong>
                        in the camps.</p>

                            where they had been knifed or machine-gunned to death.

                    </blockquote>

                    <p>In the immediate aftermath, the <strong>world was shocked</strong> by the scale and brutality of
                        the
                        massacre.
                        Graphic images and survivors' testimonies painted a picture of indiscriminate killing - men,
                        women,
                        and children were all victims of the violence.</p>

                    <h3>Israel's Complicity</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Kahan Commission, an Israeli government inquiry, presented
                        substantial evidence indicating that Israeli military <strong>leaders knew a massacre was
                            occurring</strong> and
                        yet permitted the Phalangists to continue their assault.
                    </p>

                    <p>On the second day of the massacre,
                        despite reports of the killing of women and children, then Defence Minister Ariel Sharon
                        referred to the victims as "terrorists" in need of "mopping up," saying “if you don't want the
                        Lebanese to kill them, we will kill them”, suggesting that if the Lebanese
                        forces <strong class="highlight-red">did not complete the task, Israeli forces would</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>The United Nations General Assembly declared the Sabra and Shatila massacre to be an <strong>act
                            of genocide</strong>, while the United States and Israel stood
                        alone
                        in refusing to condemn it.</p>

                    <h2 id="first-intifada">The First Intifada (1987-1993)</h2>
                    <p>The First Intifada, which lasted from 1987 to 1993, marked a significant shift in the
                        Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It was a grassroots uprising by Palestinians in the occupied
                        territories
                        against Israeli zionist occupation.</p>
                    <h3>Outbreak and Nature of the Uprising</h3>
                    <h4>Start of the Intifada</h4>
                    <p>The Intifada began with demonstrations and civil disobedience,
                        evolving from passive resistance to more active forms of protest. Palestinian society,
                        including organizations, unions, and the general population, participated in widespread
                        riots and protests.</p>
                    <h4>Tactics and Resistance</h4>
                    <p>Palestinians employed innovative methods of resistance, such as
                        boycotting Israeli goods and stone-throwing on IDF (Israeli Defense Force) vehicles.
                        Refugees in camps became major centers of action, and the resistance won sympathy
                        from Arab and Muslim countries.</p>
                    <h3>Israeli Response and Atrocities</h3>
                    <h4>Violent Repression</h4>
                    <p>Israel's response to the uprising was severe, involving killings,
                        deportations, and mass arrests of Palestinian civilians. Universities were closed, and a
                        state of emergency was declared in Palestinian areas.</p>
                    <h4>Escalation of Violence</h4>
                    <p>In 1988, Palestinian resistance escalated, including setting fire to
                        Israeli facilities. The Israeli occupation, meanwhile, faced criticism for allowing Jews to
                        dig a tunnel near Islamic holy sites in Jerusalem, leading to clashes and eventually
                        killings of Palestinians.</p>
                    <h4>Deaths and Human Rights Violations</h4>
                    <p> Israeli forces killed at least <strong class="highlight-red">1,282 Palestinian
                            civilians</strong>,
                        including
                        about 332 children. Over 100,000 Palestinians were detained, and 18,000 were held under
                        administrative detention for long period without charge or trial, and many
                        were
                        routinely tortured during the Intifada. Additionally, 2,532 Palestinian homes were
                        demolished. On the Israeli side, 60 soldiers were killed.</p>

                        Intifada. It grew as a
                        significant political and military force in Palestinian politics. The organization, which

                    <h4>Oslo I and II</h4>
                    <p>The Oslo Accords, comprising Oslo I (1993) and Oslo II (1995), were historic
                        agreements between Israel and the PLO, marking the first mutual recognition between
                        the sides. These accords aimed to establish Palestinian self-rule in parts of the West
                        Bank and Gaza, with a plan for a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Although these
                        accords were <strong>forfeiture of Palestinian rights</strong>, they were accepted by PLO in
                        a
                        bid to
                        alleviate the prolonged suffering of the Palestinian people.</p>

                    <h4>Phased Israeli Withdrawal</h4>
                    <p>The accords called for the gradual withdrawal of the Israeli
                        military from occupied territories and the transfer of authority to the Palestinian
                        Authority (PA), except for final status issues like Jerusalem and settlements, to be
                        negotiated later. However, a final treaty within five years never materialized.</p>

                    <h3>Israel Broke the Accords and Peace Promises</h3>
                    <h4>Internal Opposition</h4>
                    <p>The accords faced opposition from right-wing Israelis and settlers
                        who feared eviction from occupied territories by the returning of some lands back to
                        Palestinians. <strong>Yigal Amir</strong>, an Israeli terrorist settler,
                        <strong>assassinated</strong> Israeli
                        Prime Minister
                        <strong>Yitzhak Rabin</strong> in 1995. This assassination was an act of terrorism and a direct
                        consequence of the deep divisions and intense opposition to the peace process within
                        Israel.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Breakdown and Continued Occupation</h4>
                    <p>Israel's ongoing occupation and military
                        presence in most of the West Bank, along with continued raids into PA-administered
                        areas, signaled a slow decline of the Oslo Accords. Following Rabin's death, leaders like
                        Benjamin Netanyahu and Ariel Sharon, who opposed the accords, came to governance,
                        contributing to their erosion.</p>
                    <h4>Accelerated Settlement Growth</h4>
                    <p>Post-Oslo, Israel significantly increased its settlement
                        construction in the West Bank, tripling the pace of building. This expansion was a
                        blatant violation of the spirit of the Accords, undermining the prospect of a viable
                        Palestinian state</p>
                    <h4>Rising Tensions and Failed Talks</h4>
                    <p>The broken promise of the Oslo Accords, coupled with
                        escalating settlement, abuses, and intermittent murders by Israel, fueled Palestinian
                        frustration. The failure of
                        subsequent peace talks, including the Camp David Summit in 2000, exacerbated
                        tensions.</p>

                    <!-- Ibrahimi Mosque Massacre -->
                    <h2 id="massacre-ibrahimi-mosque">The Massacre in Ibrahimi Mosque (1994)</h2>
                    <p>On February 25, 1994, in Hebron, during the dawn prayer and amidst the overlap
                        of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and the Jewish Purim holiday, <strong>Baruch
                            Goldstein</strong>, an
                        Israeli terrorist settler and member of the extremist Kach political movement, launched an
                        attack inside the mosque. He shot and <strong class="highlight-red">killed 29 Palestinian
                            worshippers</strong> and wounded over 150
                        others.</p>
                    <h3>Eyewitness Account</h3>
                    <p>Eyewitnesses, including <strong>Hosni Issa al-Rajabeh</strong> and <strong>Khamis
                            Qafisha</strong>, a retired teacher, recalled
                        the events with vivid details. Rajabeh was present in the mosque and thought the initial
                        gunshots were fireworks for the Jewish holiday. However, he soon realized it was a shooting
                        incident as people around him were hit. Qafisha, on the other hand, noted the unusual
                        absence
                        of the Israeli army during the dawn prayer, despite previous clashes between worshippers and
                        settlers, suggesting a level of complicity or at least negligence on the part of the Israeli
                        forces.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Division of Mosque</h3>
                    <p>The aftermath of the massacre saw the Israeli government imposing strict security measures in
                        Hebron. The Ibrahimi Mosque itself was divided, with Muslim access reduced to around
                        <strong>40
                            percent</strong> of the site, and the remaining 60 percent allocated to Jewish
                        worshippers.
                        This division
                        and the ensuing security protocols, including electronic gates at the mosque's entrances,
                        significantly altered the landscape and religious practice in the area.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Hebron Protocol and Settlement Expansion</h3>
                    <p>The Hebron protocol, signed in 1997 between Israel and the PLO, further cemented these
                        changes. It divided Hebron into two areas: <strong>H1</strong>, under Palestinian Authority
                        control, and <strong>H2</strong>,
                        where Israel retained all powers, including over the Ibrahimi Mosque and the Old City. This
                        division led to a significant presence of Israeli settlers in the area surrounding the
                        mosque,
                        with
                        approximately 700 settlers living in five settlement outposts, altering the demographic and
                        cultural fabric of Hebron.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Possible Israeli Army Assistance</h3>
                    <p>The massacre is widely perceived as a planned act orchestrated by extremist settlers,
                        possibly
                        facilitated through the indirect involvement or acquiescence of the Israeli army, which was
                        notably absent during the massacre. This deliberate act was seemingly aimed at imposing a
                        new reality in Hebron and gaining control over the Ibrahimi Mosque. This event has left a
                        lasting impact on the city and its residents, with many Palestinians still feeling the
                        effects
                        of the
                        tragedy and the subsequent measures that followed.</p>

                        Masjid Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem, a site revered in Islam, sparking immediate conflict.</p>
                    <p>The Palestinians interpreted this action as a gesture towards the destruction of the Al-Aqsa
                        Mosque to make way for the construction of the Third Temple, a notion deeply
                        rooted in Israeli jews.</p>
                    <h3>Rapid Escalation of Violence</h3>
                    <p>Within days, the Intifada had spread throughout
                        Palestine and into Israel. The Israeli zionist forces <strong class="highlight-red">attacked
                            unarmed Palestinian civilians</strong>
                        leading to hundreds of casualties. Among the victims was 12-year-old Mohammad Al-Dura, whose
                        death was captured on camera, becoming a symbol of the conflict.</p>
                    <p> Israel's response included the <strong>occupation of
                            more Palestinian territories</strong>, a move directly in violation of the 1993 Oslo
                        Peace
                        Accords.</p>
                    <h3>Heightening Tensions and Armed Conflict</h3>
                    <p>In October 2000, Hamas declared a <strong>"day of rage"</strong>, intensifying the
                        conflict by fighting and attacking Israeli soldiers. The brave resistance soldiers, seeing
                        intense bombing and massacres
                        of Palestinians, went into Israeli troops while wearing bomb vests and sacrificed their
                        own lives.</p>
                    <h3>Ariel Sharon's Intensified Military Actions</h3>
                    <p>After becoming Prime Minister in March 2001, Ariel
                        Sharon initiated a military operation targeting Palestinian territories. This campaign,
                        justified by Sharon as a measure against "terrorism," appeared to be a targeted
                        bombing of Gaza civilians with no regard for women's and children's lives.</p>
                    <h4>US's Shifting Stance on Arafat</h4>
                    <p>The United States, who's been the biggest supporter of
                        Israel, began to express discontent with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, accusing him of
                        involvement in terrorism. This led to a reevaluation of US mediation efforts and
                        discussions on the Palestinian leadership and its role in the peace process.</p>

                                        policy for
                                        decades, particularly since the 1967 Six-Day War. This support encompasses
                                        substantial military
                                        aid, including advanced weaponry and defense systems like the Iron Dome, as

                                        collaborative ventures in technology and agriculture have further solidified

                    <h3 class="mt-5">UN Security Council Resolution 1397</h3>
                    <p>In 2002, the UN Security Council passed a
                        resolution envisioning two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side. Efforts for a
                        ceasefire and reform within the Palestinian Authority were supported internationally
                        but hampered by ongoing violence by Israel.</p>
                    <h3>Economic and Social Impact</h3>
                    <p>The Intifada had severe economic repercussions for both
                        Palestinians and Israelis. Palestinians faced curfews and work bans, severely affecting
                        food supplies and economic activities, while Israelis experienced economic downturns.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Deaths and Demolitions</h3>
                    <p>Over the course of the Second Intifada, at least <strong class="highlight-red">4,973
                            Palestinians
                            were killed</strong> This
                        number included 1,262 children, 274 women, and 32 medical personnel. Additionally,
                        more than 10,000 children were wounded during the five years of the uprising. The Israeli
                        army also demolished more than 5,000 Palestinian homes and severely damaged another
                        6,500.</p>
                    <p>Amnesty International reported that the majority of the Palestinian casualties <strong>were
                            civilian bystanders</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The Second Intifada also involved significant non-violent resistance by Palestinians, which
                        was
                        often overlooked by mainstream media. This resistance included organized protests against
                        the
                        Israeli military campaign, settlements, home demolitions, and the separation barrier.
                        Despite
                        its
                        predominantly non-violent nature, the response from Israeli forces was overwhelmingly
                        violent
                        and destructive.</p>

                    <h2 id="cast-lead">The Gaza Massacre: Operation Cast Lead (2008)</h2>
                    <p>Operation Cast Lead, <strong>initiated by Israel</strong>, began on December 27, 2008, and
                        lasted
                        until January
                        18, 2009. This 22-day offensive was characterized by heavy military action in the densely
                        populated Gaza Strip. The initiation of this attack from Israel represented another breach
                        in
                        the existing
                        ceasefire, further intensifying the longstanding tensions in the region.</p>
                    <p>Israeli forces conducted over 300 air and sea strikes during the first week, targeting
                        houses,
                        workshops, public institutions, mosques, and educational institutions.</p>
                    <h4>Ground Invasion</h4>
                    <p>On 3 January 2009, Israel initiated a ground invasion of Gaza. The Israeli troops, supported
                        by artillery fire and fighter jets, entered from the north. The Palestinian resistance,
                        lacking heavy weaponry, bravely faced one of the world's most well-equipped armies.
                        Israel's military tactics included attempts to cut the Strip in two and focused attacks in
                        northern towns.</p>
                    <h3>War Crimes</h3>
                    <h4>Indiscriminate Bombing</h4>
                    <p>The aerial and ground assaults targeted densely populated
                        civilian areas, leading to high civilian casualties.</p>
                    <h4>White Phosphorous</h4>
                    <p>Israel's use of white phosphorous, a chemical creating a
                        smokescreen while causing severe burns and organ failure, faced condemnation.
                        Investigations by human rights organizations confirmed the <strong class="highlight-red">use
                            of
                            white phosphorous</strong> by Israeli forces in residential areas, resulting in civilian
                        deaths and injuries. Amnesty
                        International and Human Rights Watch reported that this action potentially constituted
                        a war crime, as it violated international humanitarian laws.</p>
                    <h4>Destruction of Civilian Infrastructure</h4>
                    <p>The extensive destruction of homes, businesses,
                        and public infrastructure had a long-lasting impact on the civilian population of Gaza.</p>
                    <h4>UN Mission against War Crimes</h4>
                    <p>A UN Fact-Finding Mission concluded that there was
                        <strong>significant evidence</strong> of widespread and systematic commission of war crimes.
                        The
                        Mission noted Israel's use of disproportionate force targeted not at combatants but at
                        civilian infrastructure. Allegations of war crimes included the infamous <strong
                            class="highlight-red">killing of 21
                            members</strong> of the Samouni family and attacks on schools.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Complaints to the Israeli Military Prosecutor</h4>
                    <p>The Palestinian Centre for Human Rights
                        submitted 490 criminal complaints to the Israeli Military Prosecutor but received
                        minimal response. Israel's justice system has been accused of turning its back on
                        Palestinian victims, often extending impunity to its soldiers and officials. Obstacles for
                        Palestinians seeking compensation include prohibitive court guarantees and legislative
                        amendments exempting Israel from liability during combat actions.</p>
                    <h4>UN Security Council Resolution</h4>
                    <p>The UN Security Council called for a ceasefire on 8
                        January 2009, which was initially rejected by both Israel and Hamas. The war lasted 22
                        days in total.</p>
                    <h3>Deaths</h3>
                    <p>At least <strong class="highlight-red">1,387 Palestinians were killed</strong> with a
                        staggering
                        82%
                        being
                        civilians, whereas only 13 Israelis died, three being civilians. Israeli human rights
                        organization B'Tselem reported that among the Palestinian casualties, 344 were
                        minors/children and 110 women.</p>
                    <h4>Long-Term Impact</h4>
                    <p>The war severely damaged Gaza's infrastructure and economy. Over
                        700 businesses were destroyed, resulting in direct losses of about $140 million. The
                        agricultural sector suffered losses worth $170 million, and more than 3,354 houses were
                        destroyed. The total estimated cost of damage in Gaza reached $1.1 billion. Following
                        the war, Israel's continued blockade hampered reconstruction efforts and worsened the
                        humanitarian situation in Gaza.</p>

                    <div class="focus-section">
                        <h6>Fight for liberation vs Israeli response</h6>
                        <p>Whenever Palestinian resistance forces engaged in confrontations with Israeli soldiers,
                            ostensibly in pursuit of ending the occupation, Israel's response disproportionately
                            targeted Palestinian civilians, rather than focusing on the resistance fighters.</p>

                    <p>Post-Operation Cast Lead, Gaza's humanitarian situation deteriorated significantly:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An August 2012 UNRWA report predicted Gaza would be unliveable by 2020 due to
                            declining access to safe drinking water, healthcare, and electricity.</li>
                        <li>Israel maintained control over Gaza's borders, airspace, and coastal waters, with land
                            restrictions limiting Palestinian access to significant portions of agricultural land.
                        </li>
                        <li>The ongoing blockade led to economic hardships, with high unemployment rates and a
                            majority of the population becoming food insecure.</li>
                        <li>Health issues escalated due to unsafe water, malnutrition, and inadequate medical
                            supplies</li>
                        <li>The population density and lack of homes, with only a fraction of destroyed houses
                            being rebuilt, led to poor hygiene and public health conditions.</li>
                        <li>The mental health of Gazans was severely impacted, with increased depression rates

                    <p>The immediate trigger for Operation Pillar of Defense was a sequence of events beginning on
                        November 10, 2012. On this day, an Israeli military jeep patrolling near the Karni crossing
                        at
                        the
                        Gaza border was struck by resistance from Gaza, wounding four Israeli soldiers. In response
                        to
                        this attack, Israel launched an airstrike in Gaza, resulting in the deaths of four
                        Palestinian
                        teenagers who were <strong>playing football</strong> in a sports stadium.</p>
                    <p>After days of rocket fire from both sides, Israel launched <strong>Operation Pillar of
                            Defense</strong>, marked by
                        significant violence and destruction, against the Gaza Strip. This operation, lasting eight
                        days,
                        resulted in substantial loss of life and raised profound humanitarian and legal concerns.
                    </p>
                    <p>On 14 November, the Israeli army targeted and killed <strong>Ahmed Jabari</strong>, the chief
                        of
                        the Hamas
                        military wing, prompting widespread protests. The army also struck 20 other points in the
                        Gaza
                        Strip, including residential areas, alleging the presence of hidden weapons. More than 10
                        people were killed on the first day, including <strong class="highlight-red">11-month-old
                            Omar
                            Misharawi</strong>, the son of BBC
                        Video Editor Jihad Mishrawi.</p>
                    <h3>Escalation and Broadening of Targets</h3>
                    <p>Israeli missile strikes continued relentlessly, with Hamas responding with rocket fire into
                        Israeli
                        territories. However, no Israeli fatalities were reported from these counterstrikes. Egypt
                        attempted to mediate a brief ceasefire on November 16, but it did not hold. Israel then
                        expanded its offensive, targeting various areas, including an airstrike that destroyed the
                        offices
                        of Gaza's Prime Minister, Ismail Haniyeh. This move was condemned by international
                        organizations, highlighting the <strong>overwhelming casualties</strong> and the critical
                        shortage of medical
                        supplies in Gaza.</p>
                    <h3>Significant Incidents and Murders</h3>
                    <p>One of the most devastating incidents was an Israeli naval barrage that killed a 13-year-old
                        girl
                        and her uncle. This operation also saw the destruction of the family home of Jamal Mahmoud
                        Yassin Al-Dalu, resulting in twelve deaths, including five children and two elderly women.
                        Neighbors disputed Israel's claims of the targets' affiliations with militant groups, and
                        human
                        rights organizations criticized these actions as disproportionate and targeting civilians.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Deaths and Ceasefire</h3>
                    <p>The assault resulted in <strong class="highlight-red">185 Palestinian deaths</strong>, of
                        which
                        at
                        least 120
                        were non-combatants, and 47 were children. On the contrary, 6 Israeli soldiers died. The
                        operation
                        concluded with a ceasefire announced on November 21, following intense
                        diplomatic efforts. The aftermath of the
                        operation left the Gaza Strip in a dire humanitarian situation, with ongoing Israeli
                        aggression
                        reportedly continuing in <strong>violation of the ceasefire terms</strong>.</p>

                        breaking a ceasefire.</p>
                    <p>This offensive occurred in a context where Israel attributed the kidnapping and murder of
                        three
                        teenagers in the West Bank in June 2014 to Hamas, a claim that was not substantiated with
                        definitive proof. Hamas staunchly denied any involvement in the incident, asserting that
                        Israel
                        was using the accusation as a pretext for escalating aggression against them.</p>

                    <p>Israeli planes started <strong class="highlight-red">striking over 1,700 locations</strong>
                        in
                        Gaza,
                        including residential areas and
                        command centers. In response, Palestinian resistance rocket and mortar fire continued at a
                        sustained rate. A significant strike on 12 July resulted in 21 Palestinian casualties. By 15
                        July,
                        over 200 Palestinian casualties were reported.</p>
                    <h4>Phase Two: Ground Invasion (17–31 July)</h4>
                    <p>Israel initiated a ground attack on 17 July in response to Hamas's use of "attack tunnels."
                        The
                        ground invasion involved heavy artillery shelling and incursions, focusing on tunnel
                        threats.
                        The
                        Battle of al-Shuja'iyya was particularly fierce, with Israeli forces employing extensive
                        artillery
                        and air support, notably dropping about a <strong>hundred 2,000-pound bombs</strong> (i.e.,
                        200,000 lbs of
                        explosives). The attack resulted in at least 65 Palestinian deaths, including women,
                        children,
                        and
                        the elderly, and 288 were wounded.</p>
                    <h4>Phase Three: Hostilities and Final Cease-Fire (1–26 August)</h4>
                    <p>Intermittent hostilities continued, with cease-fires breaking down almost immediately due to
                        ongoing tunnel operations. The Hannibal Directive of Isreal led to the use of extensive
                        force,
                        resulting in at least 160 Palestinian deaths. The conflict persisted with aerial, naval, and
                        ground
                        assaults by Israel, causing significant Palestinian casualties, including an incident that
                        killed <strong class="highlight-red">10 members of one family</strong> and another at a
                        UN-run
                        school, resulting in 10 deaths and 30 injuries.
                    </p>
                    <h4>International Criticism</h4>
                    <p>Israel's actions during Operation Protective Edge drew significant international criticism
                        for
                        their disproportionate nature and the high civilian death toll.</p>
                    <p>One of the most contentious issues was the Israeli shelling of UNRWA shelters in Gaza, which
                        occurred between July 21 and August 3, 2014. These shellings resulted in the deaths of
                        <strong>at least 44 civilians</strong>, including 10 UN staff. An estimated 290,000 people,
                        approximately 15% of Gaza's
                        population, sought shelter in UNRWA schools during the conflict.
                    </p>
                    <p>The international community, including the UN and various governments, condemned these
                        attacks. The Rafah shelling, in particular, received widespread criticism. Ban Ki-moon, the
                        then UN Secretary-General, called it a <strong>"moral outrage and a criminal act,"</strong>
                        while the US State
                        Department labeled it "appalling" and "disgraceful." Human Rights Watch investigated three
                        incidents and concluded that Israel committed war crimes. The United Nations later released
                        an
                        inquiry in 2015, holding Israel responsible for the deaths of at least 44 Palestinians and
                        injuries
                        to 227 others in these shellings at UNRWA shelters.</p>
                    <h3>Deaths and Damage</h3>
                    <p>The UN reported <strong class="highlight-red">2,310 Palestinians were killed</strong>,
                        including
                        at
                        least 1,617 civilians and 513
                        children, with 70% of them under the age of 12. Over 11,100 Palestinians were injured,
                        including 3,540 women and 3,436 children. Roughly one-third of these children will have to
                        <strong>cope with disabilities</strong> lasting throughout life as a result of their
                        injuries.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Israeli bombings caused extensive material damage, with 17,800 houses destroyed or
                        severely damaged, and 252 schools and 78 hospitals affected. The total damage cost was
                        estimated at 6 billion euros, with a significant shortfall in international pledges for
                        reconstruction.
                    </p>
                    <p>On the Israeli side, 71 fatalities were reported, including 66 soldiers and 5 civilians.</p>

                    <h2 id="status-of-jerusalem">Changing Status of Jerusalem (2017)</h2>
                    <p>President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on December
                        6, 2017, increased the tensions between Palestine and Israel, marking a significant shift in
                        U.S.
                        foreign policy and breaking away from decades of precedent.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Global Response</h3>
                    <p>This decision was widely condemned internationally, including at an emergency United Nations
                        Security Council meeting where <strong>14 out of 15 members criticized</strong> the move.
                        The
                        decision was
                        seen as undermining the U.S.'s role as a mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process
                        and
                        was followed by a series of U.S. actions perceived as supportive of Israeli interests at the
                        expense of the Palestinians.</p>
                    <h3>U.S. Alters Position on International Law</h3>
                    <p>In the aftermath of this decision, the U.S. also changed its stance on Israeli settlements in
                        the
                        occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, no longer considering them illegal under
                        international
                        law, a departure from a 1978 State Department legal opinion. This move was heavily
                        criticized
                        by Palestinians and rights groups, who saw it as part of a broader series of U.S. measures
                        against the Palestinian people and their leadership.
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, under Trump's administration, the U.S. Senate approved the appointment of
                        David Friedman, a supporter of Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian land, as the U.S.
                        ambassador to Israel.</p>
                    <h3>Cutting off Aid to Palestinians</h3>
                    <p>The Trump administration also cut significant aid to the Palestinians, including funding for
                        UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and financial assistance to hospitals in East
                        Jerusalem. Other actions included closing the PLO mission in Washington, D.C., and revoking
                        visas for the PLO envoy and his family, signaling a notable deterioration in
                        U.S.-Palestinian
                        relations.</p>
                    <h3>Current status of Jerusalem</h3>
                    <p>The status of Jerusalem remains a highly contentious and complex issue. Today, both West and
                        East Jerusalem are controlled and occupied by Israel.</p>
                    <p><strong>West Jerusalem</strong> is almost-fully colonized by Jews, while <strong>East
                            Jerusalem</strong> has a significant Palestinian
                        population who face regular discrimination and violence. Palestinians in East Jerusalem also
                        live
                        under different legal and administrative rules than Israeli citizens.</p>
                    <p>Israel poses the occupation of East Jerusalem as an annexation since 1967, asserting Israeli
                        law,
                        administration, and sovereignty over the east part. This annexation is not widely recognized
                        internationally and is considered illegal by most of the international community.
                    </p>
                    <div class="focus-section">
                        <p>Annexation is considered illegal under international law if achieved through force or

                            the
                            consent of the affected population, as it violates the principle of self-determination.

                    <p>It was a series of peaceful protests along the Gaza-Israel fence beginning on March 30, 2018.
                        It
                        was marked by significant and tragic events, highlighting the
                        deep-seated issues in the Israel-Palestine conflict. This movement, extending over a period
                        of
                        more than a year, concluded on December 27, 2019.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What is the Gaza Strip?</h3>
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>The Gaza Strip, with an area of 365 square kilometers, is one of
                        the most densely populated areas in the world, housing more than two million people.
                        Historically, the area known as Gaza was larger, but it became a strip after
                        Zionist terrorists created the state of Israel in
                        1948.</p>
                    <h4>Blockade</h4>
                    <p>In 2007, Israel imposed an air, land, and sea blockade on the Strip,
                        contributing to severe economic and humanitarian crises, and putting <strong>restrictions on
                            essential resources</strong> like electricity, water, and fuel. The Zionist regime also
                        built
                        a concrete wall around the Gaza Strip, making it nearly impossible to enter or leave since
                        then.</p>
                    <h4>Collective punishment</h4>
                    <p>The United Nations and Amnesty International describe the
                        blockade as a form of <strong class="highlight-red">collective punishment</strong> of the
                        entire
                        population of Gaza,
                        amounting to a war crime and inhumane treatment under international law.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Humanitarian Crisis in Gaza</h3>
                    <h4>Economic Impact</h4>
                    <p>The blockade and restrictions have led to the collapse of Gaza's
                        economy. The World Bank reports that 50% of Gaza's population lives in poverty, with
                        youth unemployment exceeding 70%.</p>
                    <h4>Dependency on Aid</h4>
                    <p>Due to the economic collapse and infrastructural damage, Gaza has
                        become heavily dependent on international aid.</p>
                    <h4>Living Conditions</h4>
                    <p>Only 5% of water in Gaza is safe to drink, and the population suffers
                        from high levels of food insecurity. Additionally, electricity availability is severely
                        limited,
                        often to as little as four hours a day.</p>
                    <h3>Protests and Israeli Response</h3>
                    <h4>Demands</h4>
                    <p>The protests demanded the right to return to ancestral homes from which
                        Palestinians were displaced in 1948 and an end to the Israeli blockade and continuous
                        oppression.</p>
                    <h3>Deaths and Injuries</h3>
                    <p>Israeli snipers fired at the protesters, <strong class="highlight-red">killing 214
                            Palestinians</strong>,
                        including 46 children, and <strong>injuring 36,100 people, including 8,800
                            children</strong>. By
                        the end of
                        2019, 156 limb amputations were performed, and around twenty-seven people were
                        paralyzed as a result of spinal injuries. Moreover, at least 3 health workers were
                        killed and 845 injured.</p>

                    <p>Israeli forces demolished the Palestinian Bedouin community of Humsa al-Baqai'a in the Jordan
                        Valley, displacing at least 65 people, including 35 children. This demolition affected their
                        primary livelihood of herding sheep and was the seventh such incident since November 2020.
                        The demolitions left the villagers without shelter in extreme heat and were criticized

                        Israeli courts ruling in favor of Jewish settler organizations. This stemmed from a
                        long-standing
                        legal battle, with settler groups faking that land originally belonged to Jews.

                    <p>
                        The Palestinian residents, many of whom were already displaced in the past from their
                        ancestral
                        homes, faced forced displacement again, which was viewed as part of Israel's broader
                        strategy of
                        wider occupation and to alter the demographic balance in Jerusalem.

                    <h3>Violence at Al-Aqsa Mosque (May 2021)</h3>
                    <p>Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque, <strong class="highlight-red">injuring at least
                            178
                            Palestinians</strong> and hospitalizing
                        88, during the final Friday of Ramadan. The Israeli police fired rubber-coated steel rounds,
                        stun grenades, and tear gas at Palestinian worshippers including women and kids.</p>
                    <p>Many videos of
                        <strong>Israeli police beating women</strong> were recorded and condemned internationally,
                        ascertaining that
                        Israel lives on terrorism and afflicting pain on innocent civilians.

                    <h3>Widespread Protests and Riots</h3>
                    <p>Following the events in Sheikh Jarrah and Al-Aqsa
                        Mosque, widespread protests and riots occurred globally. Pro-Palestine solidarity marches
                        demanded sanctions and a military embargo against Israel.</p>

                    <h3>Conflict (May, 2021)</h3>
                    <p>
                        The conflict was precipitated by two key events in East Jerusalem: the eviction of
                        Palestinian
                        families in Sheikh Jarrah and Israeli police violence at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Faced with ongoing Israeli actions against Palestinian worshippers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque,
                        including
                        violent and aggressive measures impacting women and children, Hamas demanded Israel withdraw
                        its
                        security forces from the area. When this demand was not met, Hamas launched rockets into
                        Israeli
                        territories.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Israeli bombardment on Gaza</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Israeli military launched an extensive airstrike campaign against the Gaza Strip for
                        consecutive 11 days. The
                        strikes were reported to be the most intense since the 2014 conflict. Severe loss of
                        Palestinian
                        lives were witnessed. Moreover, key infrastructures, including residential buildings and
                        media
                        offices, were hit, demolishing about 1,800 residential units and damaging at
                        least 14,300 other units.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Destruction of Hanadi Tower and Al-Jalaa Building</h3>
                    <p>Israeli forces bombed and
                        destroyed the 13-story residential Hanadi Tower and the Al-Jalaa building in Gaza City,
                        which housed more than <strong>60 residential apartments</strong> and several media offices,
                        including
                        Al Jazeera and The Associated Press. This act was condemned by the affected media
                        outlets as an attempt to hinder journalistic efforts and was viewed as a serious
                        escalation.</p>

                    <h3>Ceasefire</h3>
                    <p>
                        A ceasefire, mediated by Egypt, was reached after 11 days. However, it left unresolved the
                        deeper
                        issues at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including the status of East
                        Jerusalem
                        and
                        the ongoing Israeli occupation.

                        In May 2021, at least <strong class="highlight-red">287 Palestinians were killed</strong> by

                    <p><strong>Gaza</strong>: 256 Palestinians, including 66 children and 40 women, were killed.
                        Additionally, more than 1,900 others wereinjured.</p>
                    <p><strong>West Bank:</strong> 31 people were killed.</p>

                            Palestinians,
                            including
                            17 children</strong>. The attack followed the arrest of Bassam al-Saadi, a Palestinian
                        Islamic
                        Jihad
                        leader, in the West Bank. Following the arrest, Israel closed its crossings into Gaza,
                        including
                        the
                        Karem Abu Salem commercial crossing, which blocked the entry of fuel for Gaza's only power

                    <p>In response to Israel's actions, several small armed
                        Palestinian resistance groups emerged in the West Bank, particularly in Jenin and Nablus.
                        These
                        groups clashed with Israeli forces and carried out attacks against Israeli military soldiers
                        at
                        checkpoints.</p>
                    <h3>Campaign "Break the Wave"</h3>
                    <p>Israel launched another operation in continuation of its ethnic
                        cleansing of Palestinians, one of the "mowing of lawns" operations, called <strong>"Break
                            the
                            Wave"</strong>
                        involving near-daily raids, mass arrests, and killings in the West Bank, especially in Jenin
                        and
                        Nablus. Israeli forces <strong class="highlight-red">killed at least 170
                            Palestinians</strong>
                        in
                        these operations, including more than
                        30
                        children, and injured at least 9,000 others.</p>

                                        The term "mowing the lawn" is a phrase used by some to describe
                                        Israel's military strategy towards Gaza, particularly relating to periodic
                                        large-scale military operations or airstrikes. Critics argue that this
                                        strategy
                                        is part of a broader approach to maintain control over the Palestinian
                                        population and territory.

                                        Notably, during these operations, heavy number of
                                        indiscriminate bombing and civilian casualties are witnessed. People with
                                        Huamnitarian aspects see these as a form of systematic ethnic cleansing.

                    <h3>Formation of a Far-Right Government in Israel</h3>
                    <p>Israeli parliamentary elections resulted in the formation of a far-right government.
                        Controversial figures in this government have been known for their incitement of violence
                        against Palestinians and have expressed intentions to deepen illegal Israeli settlement
                        building
                        in the West Bank.</p>
                    <h3>Increase in Settler Attacks</h3>
                    <p>Attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank became more frequent and
                        coordinated. The UN noted an increase in settler violence facilitated by Israeli forces,
                        leading
                        to
                        the death of numerous Palestinians and terrorizing communities.

                            expansion of

                            attacks on Gaza. He highlighted violations of international humanitarian law, such as
                            attacks causing disproportionate civilian harm and targeting civilian infrastructure
                            like

                    <h3>Context and Outbreak</h3>
                    <p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas launched a military operation called <strong>"Operation
                            Al-Aqsa
                            Flood"</strong> into Israeli territory, marked by the firing of thousands of rockets,
                        most
                        of which were
                        intercepted by the Iron Dome. This unprecedented attack, which took Israel by surprise, led
                        to
                        the death of at least 460 combatants i.e. soliders and police, and the capture of dozens of
                        Israeli hostages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An Israeli soldier's testimony raises questions about whether IDF fired on their own
                        civilians
                        under the
                        "Hannibal Protocol" on October 7.
                        Moreover, it is said that several armed settlers initiated gunfire against
                        resistance fighters, leading to a
                        confrontation. As a result of this clash, there were casualties among the settlers.
                    </p>

                    <!-- <h3>Controversies about Israeli casualties</h3>
                        <p>
                            The IDF first claimed 1,400 Israelis were killed, then revised the death toll to what they call now "around 1,200."
                            Haretz, an Israeli newspaper, listed the number of casualties, showing at least 460 were combatants (soliders + police).
    
                            Moreover, it is
                            said that several armed settlers initiated gunfire against resistance fighters, leading to a
                            confrontation. As a result of this clash, there were casualties and injuries among the settlers.
    
                            Some claims have been made that IDF killed their own 
                        </p> -->

                    <h3>Why did Hamas attack?</h3>
                    <p>Mohammed Deif, the Hamas military commander, regarding the attack, said: "This is the day of
                        the greatest battle to <strong class="highlight-blue">end the last occupation on
                            Earth</strong>"
                    </p>
                    <p>This statement reflects Hamas' perspective on the conflict, characterizing it as a
                        significant
                        battle to liberate Palestine from the brutal occupation.</p>

                    <h3>Israel's Actions and Atrocities</h3>
                    <p>In reply to the Hamas attack on October 7th, the Israeli forces dropped thousands of bombs on
                        Gaza indiscriminately, leveling several parts of Gaza, instead of fighting Hamas
                        fighter-to-fighter
                        through ground invasion. Here are some of the main assaults:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>65,000+ tons of bombs:</strong>
                            Israel has dropped over 65,000 tons of
                            missiles and bombs on Gaza Strip, that's about 178 tons per km2, <strong
                                class="highlight-red">3 times more than</strong> the bomb dropped on
                            Hiroshima.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Loss of Life:</strong>
                            At least <strong class="highlight-red">26,083 Palestinian civilians</strong> have been
                            killed,
                            including
                            10,000 children and 7,000 women. Additionally, at least 64,487 people are injured, with
                            more than 75% being children and women. More than 8,000 people are missing.

                            <strong>Bombing of Al-Ahli Arab Hospital:</strong>
                            Israel bombed Gaza's oldest hospital, <strong>Al Ahli Arab</strong>, on
                            the 17th of October, 2023, <strong class="highlight-red">killing nearly 500
                                people</strong>
                            marking the highest death toll of
                            any single incident in Gaza during the genocide. The victims were mostly displaced
                            people seeking shelter in the hospital. On the day of the strike, the hospital was
                            overwhelmed with about 1,000 to 3,000 people, as it and other medical facilities in Gaza
                            had been crammed with casualties beyond their capacity since the Israeli airstrikes
                            began.
                            <br><br>
                            The bombing was denounced by world leaders, with strong statements from
                            Middle Eastern countries. Jordan canceled a planned summit with U.S. President Joe
                            Biden in response to the incident. Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, condemned
                            Israel's bombardment of the hospital. Saudi Arabia also issued a firm statement
                            condemning the attack.

                            <strong>Destruction of Healthcare Facilities:</strong>
                            15 out of 36 hospitals in Gaza are partially functional, and several of them, including
                            Al-Quds and Al-Shifa, faced severe crises. They ceased
                            operations due to a lack of fuel and the <strong class="highlight-red">cutting off of
                                electricity by Israel.</strong>

                            A tragic highlight of this assault is the death of about <strong class="highlight-red">100
                                Palestinian journalists</strong> and media workers, making this period the deadliest
                            for
                            journalists since records began in 1992. Moreover, at least three Lebanese journalists
                            were also killed.

                            <strong>Collective Punishment:</strong>
                            Israel stopped the entry of water, electricity, fuel, and aid
                            into Gaza, exacerbating the crisis. <strong class="highlight-red">9 out of 10 people go
                                without food</strong> for the whole day. The UN denounced this as a form of collective
                            punishment.

                            <strong>The Second Nakba:</strong>
                            On November 10, intense bombing and armed pressure by Israel
                            resulted in the displacement of approximately 200,000 Palestinians within Gaza from
                            the north to the south. Overall, since October 7, the conflict has led to the
                            <strong class="highlight-red">displacement of over 1.6 million</strong> people from
                            their
                            homes.
                            This mass displacement significantly
                            strained the already fragile humanitarian situation in the region.

                            <br><br>
                            The displacement of Gazans is especially poignant considering the historical context.

                            majority of Gaza's population are refugees or descendants of refugees who were forcibly
                            expelled from their ancestral homes during the founding of the apartheid state of Israel
                            in
                            1948. This recent displacement reignited a <strong>painful sense of déjà vu</strong> for
                            many Gazans.

                            <br><br>
                            This migration was characterized by large groups of people, including families with
                            children, the
                            elderly, and those with disabilities, who <strong>fled on foot</strong> with minimal
                            belongings, often waving
                            white flags as a sign of their civilian status. Multiple videos have confirmed that
                            Israeli
                            <strong>soldiers fired at civilians</strong>, including those fleeing barefoot from the
                            north waving white flags.

                    <p>Below are several statements made by current and former members of the Israeli government
                        after October 7, which compellingly indicate an intention towards the ethnic cleansing of
                        Palestinians, rather than a focused engagement with resistance fighters. These statements
                        highlight a disregard for the civilian population in Gaza, underscoring a lack of concern
                        for
                        the
                        lives of women and children:

                    <p>It's also crucial to highlight that, despite the <strong>absence of Hamas in the West

                        forces

                        injured 3,949
                        people
                        there from Oct 7 to Jan 10. This raises serious questions about the targets of these
                        operations,
                        given that Hamas, often cited as a primary reason for Israeli military actions, does not
                        have a
                        presence in the West Bank.</p>

                        concerning deliberate civilian killings and indiscriminate attacks.</p>

                            During the conflict, up to 250 hostages were seized by Hamas,

                            <strong>Deaths and Displacement:</strong> By the end of the first week, Israel bombed
                            2,808
                            people, including 853 children and 936 women. Over 10,000 people were wounded, and more
                            than one million were displaced within Gaza.

                            Israel's intense bombing campaign pushed Gaza toward
                            a humanitarian catastrophe. The Israeli Defense Force dropped bombs equivalent to a
                            quarter of a nuclear bomb, primarily targeting civilians and residential infrastructure.

                            <strong>Humanitarian Crisis:</strong>
                            Israel stopped the entry of food, water, electricity, fuel, and aid
                            into Gaza, exacerbating the crisis. The UN denounced this as a form of collective
                            punishment.

                            In the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, Palestinians
                            faced unchecked violence from Israeli settlers and soldiers, with more than 59
                            Palestinians killed in 10 days.

                            Israel bombed Al-Ahli Arab Hospital, the oldest in Gaza, killing
                            nearly 500 people, marking the highest death toll of any single incident in Gaza during
                            the genocide.

                            the area, resulting in the tragic loss of at least 18 lives.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Continued Military Operations:</strong>
                            Israeli forces carried out a drone strike in Jenin, killing
                            three Palestinians. During a raid at the Ibn Sina Hospital in Jenin, one of the largest
                            medical facilities in the Palestinian territories, Israeli forces arrested two
                            paramedics
                            and ordered the hospital's evacuation, causing further damage to infrastructure.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Agreement for Truce:</strong>
                            A four-day truce was agreed between Israel and Hamas. This
                            period followed extensive bombardment of Gaza by the Israeli army, resulting in
                            significant casualties and destruction.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Truce Conditions:</strong>
                            The truce involved both sides agreeing to a pause in fighting. As part
                            of the agreement, Hamas consented to release 50 civilian women and children, while
                            Israel agreed to release 150 Palestinian women and children held captive in its prisons.
                            The deal was expected to allow increased humanitarian aid flow into Gaza.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Mediation and International Involvement:</strong>
                            Qatar mediated the truce, in coordination
                            with the US and Egypt.

                        <li>
                            <strong>Uncertainty and Military Presence:</strong>
                            Despite the truce, Israeli forces reportedly injured 7
                            Palestinians, and drone activity was observed over Gaza, raising concerns about the
                            truce's stability.
